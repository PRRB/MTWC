// ii) If untranslated string will have 
// (!ENG!) (!FRA!) (!DEU!) 
// (!ITA!) (!ESP!) (!JAP!) 
// (!SCH!) (!TCH!) (!KOR!)
// at the end of the string.
// This is so we can detect untranslated strings

// translated when the program has been run.
// Once the translation has been done acceptably
// they should be removed.
