["Denmark_Major"]
{"With Viking blood, the people of the North have come to "
"dominate the world. Masters of the sea, invincible on land, "
"indomitable in spirit, favoured by God, how could they not "
"create a mighty empire? No corner of the world has not felt "
"the force of their power. Sometimes they went in search of "
"plunder, sometimes for trade, sometimes to settle, but always "
"with the spirit of true Vikings. Not all pay homage to the "
"Kings of the Danes but their swords have remade the world."}

["Denmark_Minor"]
{"In the harsh cold lands of the North lies a mighty kingdom "
"peopled by a proud people. Their ancestors voyaged far across "
"the seas in search of plunder and to trade and much of their "
"old Viking spirit still lives on. Their merchants range far and wide, "
"bringing back the bounty of other lands. And though his lands are "
"civilized and prosperous, the King of the Danes can still unleash "
"the fury of the Norsemen upon his foes..."}

["England_Major"]
{"From this sceptred isle, set in a silvered sea, came a lionhearted "
"race of kings that would change the world forever. From their "
"island fastness, their ships dominated the seas, bringing trade "
"and wealth and allowing them to strike their enemies at will. "
"Their power spread, first, across the Old World and then across "
"the New, creating an empire whose pomp and majesty surpasses "
"anything that had gone before: "
"creating an empire upon which the sun never sets."} 

["England_Minor"]
{"Rulers of a green and pleasant land, the Kings of England grew "
"rich and powerful in their island kingdom and their people were "
"prosperous and merry. The sea served as a moat and their ships as "
"wooden walls, protecting all from invasion. From their royal "
"seat in London, they also ruled many lands beyond the sea while "
"their navies ranged far across the oceans, bringing the rich "
"bounty of the world to their doors."}

["France_Major"]
{"Vive la France! Vive l'emperor! Great is his glory and that "
"of the French nation. Supreme in power and wealth and rich in "
"civilization and culture, its armies have ranged across the "
"continent and beyond, taking possession of men's bodies, "
"while its civilization conquers men's hearts. Not even the "
"ancients could match the splendour of the French nation. "
"Long may it endure! Vive la France!"}

["France_Minor"]
{"Heirs to Charlemagne, the Kings of France rival his ancient "
"greatness. Ringed around by enemies and afflicted with "
"disunity at home, they have overcome these difficulties, "
"smashed their enemies on the field of battle and forged a "
"new nation! A nation that once more can be the leader of "
"Europe, the defender of Christendom and usher in a new age "
"of progress and enlightenment."}

["Germany_Major"]
{"A thousand years ago the tribes of Germany fell upon the "
"Roman Empire and brought it low, plunging the world into "
"darkness. Now they have built that Empire anew, twice as "
"glorious as before! Elected by his lesser princes, the "
"Kaiser holds the fate of Europe in his hands. Providing "
"peace and security throughout his mighty realm, he defends "
"Christendom from the heathens beyond his borders. Truly "
"does he deserve the title of Holy Roman Emperor!"}

["Germany_Minor"]
{"Claiming the heritage of Charlemagne and claiming the "
"heritage of Rome, the Holy Roman Empire dominates central "
"Europe and its power is felt in many lands beyond. Ruling "
"a land of petty princes and prosperous cities, the Kaiser "
"defends the lands of his empire against heathen and heretic "
"alike - his power cows the infidel and no jealous Christian "
"prince dares to challenge him. Hail to the new Caesar!"}

["Italy_Major"]
{"It is given to few nations to spawn two mighty empires. "
"Yet, just as the might of Rome was rooted in Italian soil, "
"now, an even greater empire has arisen. Masters of the "
"military and political arts, the princes of Italy - once "
"petty tyrants ruling squabbling cities - became masters "
"of the known world. Yet, these are not brutish conquerors. "
"Not since the time of the Greeks have one people been so "
"pre-eminent in culture, art, architecture, music and the "
"sciences. Truly this new empire will lift the souls of all men!"}

["Italy_Minor"]
{"The new Italy is a shining example of modernity. Its once "
"divided cities have united in a mighty state for the common "
"good. Under its protection people enjoy their lives in peace. "
"Their armies and navies bring security, their trade brings "
"wealth and luxury and their mastery of art and literature "
"brings them enjoyment. This is an oasis of light in a "
"dark world and it is here that civilization is reborn."}

["Spain_Major"]
{"They set out to reclaim their homeland and ended up "
"claiming the whole world. Throwing back the infidel "
"invader that had blighted their land and laying their "
"yoke upon the continent of Europe, their fleets voyaged "
"across the oceans to new lands, all for the glory of the "
"King of Spain. Their missionaries brought the glory of "
"Jesus Christ to the whole world while Spanish armies "
"smashed infidels, pagans and heretics that all men might "
"bow their heads in prayer to the one God."} 

["Spain_Minor"]
{"In the land between Europe and Africa, between the "
"calmness of the middle sea and the stormy ocean, was "
"founded the Kingdom of Spain. Reclaiming their land "
"from the infidel invaders, they forged a strong kingdom "
"that never again would be overrun. Steadfast in religion, "
"humble before God, they could be proud before lesser men. "
"Their great ships voyaged far, seeking out new lands and "
"trade, such that the wealth of the King of Spain became rightly legendary."}

["Byzantium_Major"]
{"Constantinople: the eternal, the unchanging, the centre "
"of the world. City that was born of Rome, surpassing even "
"that ancient glory. For two thousand years the heirs of the "
"Caesars have ruled from their capital on the Bosporus. "
"There were dark days of danger and despair. Many lands "
"were overrun by foes but in the end the triumph was theirs. "
"An empire that was lost has been regained. A flame that "
"died has been rekindled. A glory, once tarnished, has been reborn!"}

["Byzantium_Minor"]
{"Just as with their forefathers in Rome, the power and "
"glory of the emperors of Byzantium shines forth like a "
"beacon. Some lands are directly under their sway. "
"In others their name is whispered with awe. For more "
"than a thousand years, since Rome was lost to the barbarians, "
"the city of Constantine and its empire has stood as an island "
"of civilization in a cruel and barbarous world. Long may it endure!"}

["Poland_Major"]
{"In the centre only the strong survive. And from the "
"centre they came: from an open, defenceless land beset "
"by enemies. This was the crucible that forged them, hardened "
"them, that gave them the strength to throw back their enemies "
"and it gave them power to create a new empire - a Polish empire - 
"to tie the vast, empty lands of the East with the rich provinces "
"of the West. From the centre they came and from the centre they ruled."}

["Poland_Minor"]
{"In the centre only the strong survive. In a land with "
"few defensible borders, beset by enemies, survival itself "
"is victory. To survive and prosper, to have your enemies "
"cower before you, to claim your place in the annals of "
"history: this is victory indeed!"}

["Russia_Major"]
{"At the crossroads between Europe and Asia, "
"beset by bitter enemies and by a climate more bitter "
"still, this was an unlikely land for the birthplace "
"of a great nation and yet here it was born. This was "
"the genius of the Russian people, their triumph: to "
"overcome great obstacles, endure great hardships, to "
"build a state of imperial greatness that bestrides Europe "
"and Asia like a colossus, to grind enemies into the dust, "
"to transcend the glory of the greatest of ancient empires. "
"The Tsar is great. Long may he rule!"}

["Russia_Minor"]
{"Theirs is a new land, a land of vast empty spaces, a "
"land of the harshest kind, surrounded by many barbarous "
"peoples. In a land that would have broken lesser men, the "
"Russians not only survived but prospered. Their Tsars carved "
"out a great state, mighty in military power and civilization. "
"Conquerors and builders both, their names are feared and "
"admired in equal measure."}

["Almohad_Major"]
{"On the western fringes of Islam, a mighty empire was born. "
"Its armies swept across the world, taking many lands, yet "
"greatness is measured in more than just armies and wealth. "
"In an age of fear and bigotry, the new rulers brought a "
"spirit of tolerance, extending to each man the freedom to "
"worship as he will, asking in return only obedience to God. "
"All tremble before the power of the Khalifah's armies, yet they "
"do also marvel at the glories of his realm: its "
"architecture, gardens and, above all, its science and "
"learning. The Khalifah has brought a taste of paradise "
"to those on earth."}

["Almohad_Minor"]
{"On the western fringes of Africa and Europe, the "
"Khalifah rules over a pleasant and bountiful kingdom. "
"Their citizens excel at the arts and sciences. Its "
"scholars keep great libraries; its architects raise "
"great palaces, and create pleasant gardens. The leaders "
"of the Kingdom follow the teachings of Islam, revealed "
"through the Quran and the Sunnah, as do many of their people. "
"Even the barbarous Christians of the north cannot but be awed "
"by the wealth and grandeur of this land."}

["Egypt_Major"]
{"And so it came to pass that on the very banks of the "
"Nile, where civilization itself had begun so many years "
"before, a new civilization arose. Its rulers were mighty, "
"and, with Allah's blessing, their armies swept across the "
"continents of Europe and Asia, carrying civilization and "
"faith with them. And so it is today, that all men "
"prostrate themselves towards Allah, facing Mecca, and "
"rightly revere the verses of the Quran."}

["Egypt_Minor"]
{"In the land of Egypt, so mighty so many centuries "
"ago, a new power emerged. Its rulers were not Pharoahs "
"but followers of Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) and "
"their armies went forth and smote the infidels and kept all "
"their lands safe for the people of the Faith. And, as in "
"days of yore, all men were in awe of the wealth and glory "
"of their kingdom."}

["Turkey_Major"]
{"Born in the saddle were their ancestors. Born to "
"endure. Born to range forever across the land but "
"born also to take and use the wisdom and knowledge of "
"those they had conquered. From this tribe, the Sultans "
"of the Turks forged a formidable weapon. Combining the "
"arts of the cities and the ferocity of the nomad, they "
"created a perfect army: an army that would overcome "
"any obstacle; an army that would vanquish any foe; "
"an army that would conquer an empire. And so it is "
"that when the Sultan lifts up his hand, all men tremble."}

["Turkey_Minor"]
{"Their ancestors came from the centre of Asia, bringing "
"with them their flocks of sheep. With their nomadic "
"ferocity, they quickly overran the settled peoples in "
"the lands they now own. Combining the crafts of the "
"cities with their own traditions of warfare, the Turkish "
"army became a formidable weapon - winning many victories "
"and creating a great empire. The Sultan's rule now extends "
"over many lands and spreads the glory of the religion of "
"Islam throughout them."}
