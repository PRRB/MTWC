// Notes to translators.
//
// i) Only those things between 
// {""} need to be translated.
// and the 
// {""} should be left in.
// (Unless otherwise specified.)
//
//
// ii) If untranslated a string will have 
// (!ENG!) (!FRA!) (!DEU!) 
// (!ITA!) (!ESP!) (!JAP!) 
// (!SCH!) (!TCH!) (!KOR!)
// at the end of the string.
// This is so we can detect untranslated stings
// easily and can see that they have no been 
// translated when the program has been run.
// Once the translation has been done acceptable
// they should be removed.


// iii) The data is organised as follows 
// 
// ["this is a label"]
// {"This is the translation"}
//
// ["This is another label"]
// {"This is another translation"}
// etc


//
// Comments are ignored and will be stripped out later
// They can be used to issue instructions or for information.

{"A valley and steep cliff to the right of the castle could hide invaders.  The castle is at high altitude and can be very foggy. A foreground of bleak wide open space is only interrupted by a window road. Attacker who use this obvious route will be easily spotted and picked off."}

The castle is built on slightly raised land with a clear view but the enemy can come from any side.
