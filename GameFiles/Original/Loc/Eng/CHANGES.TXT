For the rest of his life, Scottish entanglements dragged Edward's armies into Scotland. Scotland was occupied, but never pacified. In 1306 a new claimant to the Scottish throne, Robert the Bruce, emerged and challenged the English once again. He murdered a rival, seized the crown and then faced the problem of English garrisons throughout Scotland. His early campaigns ended in failure and semi-exile but he was hugely helped by the death of Edward I. The new king of England, Edward II, was not a military, political or any other kind of genius! In 1313 Robert's troops captured Perth and in 1314 Edinburgh fell, but the key confrontation came at Bannockburn, as Edward II lead an army to relieve the siege of Stirling. Robert's forces had surrounded the English garrison in the town and were effectively starving them out. Robert the Bruce chose not to let Edward through, but to attack, even though he was outnumbered and the English were mounted. His pike-armed troops gave him the advantage, as did the ground he chose. Edward II also helped Robert by running away and panicking his own army. The defeat of the English was total and Edward was never able to challenge Robert's control of Scotland again. Bannockburn marked a change in English warfare, as lessons learned from the Scots were applied to English armies. It was the last time the English would field an army of predominantly mounted knights. From now on, they would fight on foot and this change would lead to many victories against the French in later wars. It wasn't until Edward II suffered a horrible and painful death on the orders of his wife, Isabella of France, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, that peace finally came. The new rulers of England and Robert signed the Treaty of Northampton in 1328. This recognised the fact of Scottish independence, a prize won at Bannockburn that was to last for 400 years."}
["Bannockburn_Conditions"]			{"To win at Bannockburn, you must match the achievements of Robert the Bruce, by forcing the English army to rout off the field. This will probably involve killing many of them, so you should also ensure that Robert survives and that your own forces do not run away."}

// ********* Historical Battles *************

["Hastings_Title"]				{"Battle of Hastings 1066"}
["Hastings_Rating"]				{""}
["Hastings_Description"]		{"Medieval: Total War presents the climactic section of Hastings: the last assaults by the Normans on the previously impregnable Saxon/English army. With the death of the king of England, Edward the Confessor, in 1066 Duke William of Normandy (called 'William the Bastard' by his contemporaries) was convinced that the throne of England rightfully belonged to him. He had promises from Edward, and oaths taken by another potential candidate, Harold Godwinson, to back up his claim. Or so he thought...however, it was not to be. Godwinson took the throne for himself as Harold II of England and William was outraged by the effrontery of his rival. It didn't take him long to raise an invasion army, staffed with men eager to plunder England and take its land for themselves. William's forces crossed the English Channel in September, late in the year for any kind of large-scale naval operation, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex. In an attempt to provoke a battle he immediately lay waste the surrounding countryside and waited for a response. For the moment, though, Harold II was distracted by another problem. Harald Hardraade of Norway and his own brother Tostig had crossed the North Sea and landed in Yorkshire with 300 shiploads of Vikings. Harold II, by good generalship and luck, ambushed them at Stamford Bridge; the defeated Vikings had just enough men to crew six longships for the return journey. One threat defeated, Harold and the core of his army immediately rushed south to meet William's army, covering the distance between York and the south coast (on rough tracks rather than good roads) in a few days. Harold and William meet at Senlac Hill, north of Hastings, near what is now the small town of Battle. Harold had chosen his ground for the fight with a professional's eye: a defensible hilltop where his infantry would have the advantage against the Norman cavalry forces. All morning, the battle raged as the Normans threw attack after attack up the slope of Senlac Hill, but the Saxon/English 
line sto
o
d firm, even when the Normans pretended to run away. Then, after a scare that Duke William had been slain, there was yet another Norman attack... Hastings turned out to be one of the defining moments of Western history. England ceased to be a Saxon-, Viking- or Scandinavian-dominated land, and was drawn into the European world of feudalism and absolute Catholic primacy, ironically enough by conquest at the hands of a descendant of Vikings!"}
["Hastings_Conditions"]			{"The English/Saxon army must be defeated. Your Norman army must avoid defeat, and Duke William of Normandy must not be killed, captured or driven from the field."}
["Hastings_Trigger1_Desc"]		{"King William must survive"}
["Hastings_Trigger2_Desc"]		{"Your army must not be defeated by the English"}
["Hastings_Trigger3_Desc"]		{"You must defeat the English army"}
["Hastings_Trigger4_Desc"]		{"You must kill King Harold"}
["Hastings_Trigger5_Desc"]		{"If Harold escapes the battlefield you cannot claim victory."}




["Stirling_Bridge_Title"]				{"Battle of Stirling Bridge 1297"}
["Stirling_Bridge_Rating"]				{"Easy"}
["Stirling_Bridge_Description"]			{"Two deaths lead to the end of more than 100 years of peace between Scotland and England and ushered in 250 years of rivalry, warfare, savage hatred, and border skirmishes. The rivalries and dislikes stirred up in these times are still felt today: just ask any Scotsman for an opinion on the English! The first death, that of Alexander III of Scotland happened in 1286. The Scottish lords declared his infant granddaughter Margaret, the Maid of Norway, to be their new Queen, and all seemed well. In 1290 Edward I of England negotiated a treaty of marriage between Margaret and his own son, the future Edward II, but sadly Margaret died on the voyage from Norway to England. She was eight years old, and her death marked the end of peace in Scotland. Although the marriage treaty had been quite clear that Scotland was to remain an independent country, Edward I had his own agenda. He declared himself overlord of Scotland and the Scottish lords played into his hands by agreeing that he arbitrated in choosing a new king. Edward chose a puppet, John de Balliol, who went so far as to do homage to him. Even this wasn't enough for Edward. His constant interference in Scottish affairs eventually provoked even de Balliol into resistance. An alliance with France was the result, and Edward invaded Scotland to reassert his claims to be overlord. He rapidly conquered the country, and even removed the Stone of Scone (the Scottish symbol of kingship) to Westminster, and de Balliol was imprisoned in the Tower of London. But the Scots had found a champion: William Wallace (or 'Walays', as medieval spelling had a tendency to change at random) was the second son of an obscure family, but he had proved to be a canny fighter and rebel. His campaign in 1296 into England had been successful, and he was rewarded with knighthood in his own right and proclaimed guardian of Scotland, ruling in de Balliol's name. In 1297 an English army was determined to bring order (as they saw it) once more to Scotland. The w
alled town of Stirling dominated the Forth valley, and needed to be taken. In front of the English was a rough-and-ready army of Scotsmen, determined that they would not be underlings in their own country. John de Warrene, the English commander, sent a message to the Scots, giving them the chance to surrender in return for a royal pardon. Sir William Wallace's reply made sure that there would be no surrender, and that Stirling Bridge would be a famous victory for him and Scottish arms: 'Tell your people that we have not come here to gain peace, but are prepared for battle, to avenge and deliver our country. Let them come up when they like, and they will find us ready to meet them even to their beards. In the end, William Wallace was to pay a harsh penalty for his successes. In 1305, he was hung, drawn and quartered as a traitor. The English saw him not as a fighter for an independent nation, but as a rebel against his legal overlords..."}
["Stirling_Bridge_Conditions"]			{"The victory conditions for Stirling Bridge are simple: defeat the English army by killing, capturing or driving men from the field by rout. William Wallace must not be killed, run away or be captured during the battle."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ALMOHAD_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Almohad Caliphate is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Almohad Caliphate is a faction with many strengths at this time. In the early period it is one of the easier factions in the game to command. Its troops, especially Desert Archers and Berber Camels (exclusively available to the Almohads), are forces that can be very useful against the weaker opponents encountered in early battles. The Almohad strategic position is also fairly secure. The Caliphate may look as if it could be crushed on two fronts, but this is deceptive. In the west there are provinces that are ripe for conquest or bribery. In the east the desert gives space to retreat and absorb an attack before retaliating, or immediate access into Egypt, and taking Egypt could deal an almost-mortal blow to the Egyptians."}
@{"Coming from a nomadic desert people, the Berber tribesmen of the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties conquered North Africa and then, at the request of the Iberian Muslim princes, came to Spain to protect Islam. In the process, they took Spain for themselves. When the Almoravids abandoned their simple lifestyle in favour of the comfort and luxury of sophisticated city life, the Almohads turned their backs on such lax and easy living, and in doing so sealed the fate of the Almoravids. They were overthrown."}
@{"The Almohad Caliphate now stretches along North Africa and into Spain. The Khalifah's rule to date has been hard, uncompromising and very successful. The Almohads get little love from the Christians and Jews that they rule, as earlier liberal attitudes towards both groups have been abandoned, but this lack of loyalty has had little impact. The Almohads have some remarkable strengths as rulers: their military prowess is superb, their religiously inspired troops have few equals, and they feel little fear of the resurgent Christian Spanish in Castile. They hold down an unenthusiastic population and still manage to mount major military expeditions. But this unpopularity could also be a weakness - constant vigilance in the face of disaffected people can be tiring for any regime."}
@{"The Caliphate's rulers are, however, better placed to carry their conquests further into Christian Europe than any other Islamic power. They stand ready to wear down Spain, if not crush it outright. A weakened France could then be their next target, swinging south into Italy or north towards the rich pickings of England's continental holdings. Holding off Spanish aggression, should it come, would also give them the chance to attack in the Mediterranean, towards Egypt and then the Holy Land."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_BYZANTINE_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Fairly Easy. Playing the Byzantine Empire is slightly easier for any given difficulty setting than most other factions in the game."}
@{"In the early period of the game, the Byzantine Empire is in its strongest position, and in later starting periods the overall situation will never again be as favourable for a Byzantine commander. The Empire is large, owns potentially rich lands, and has other sources of wealth close by. The Empire can soon develop a strong economy in Constantinople, but its military forces are thinly spread and training facilities are completely centralized and therefore slow to create a large number of military units. The Empire can afford to create a strong army, but this can take time that may not be available! All that said, the Byzantine army has access to more exclusive units than any other Christian kingdom, including the supremely heavy Kataphraktoi cavalry. Any Byzantine commander must also give serious consideration to developing a taste for bribery, espionage and murder if the military options are not ruthlessly pursued."}
@{"The Byzantine Empire is the child of the Roman Empire, or rather the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire. It has always been a power in the world, ruled by despots and assassins, fools and wise men, poets and generals - all combining religious and political authority in one man. That it has survived and even prospered is a tribute to its underlying strengths, and the luck of the Empire's position at the crossroads of the world. Almost no trade moves east or west without making Byzantium richer and filling the Emperor's coffers with taxes. This wealth and the heavy tolls needed to sustain the Imperial court can be a cause of envy and resentment from other peoples."}
@{"Constantinople or Byzantium was founded as the second Rome by Constantine the Great, and is the greatest city in Europe and may be the greatest in the world. Its walls are impregnable, its armies fearsome, its people impossibly wealthy and cultured. Byzantine coinage effortlessly dominates the world of trade and can be used to buy goods the world over. In matters of religion, the Byzantine patriarchs are unwilling to recognise the Papacy's claim to superior status, as the schism between the Orthodox and Catholic halves of Christianity goes unhealed."}
@{"Byzantium, however, does face problems, yet within those problems could be opportunities for further greatness. The Empire has had a measure of security thanks to the skills of its mercenary armies, and has held on to many of its ancient frontiers even in the face of Islamic expansion. Now, while the troops remain as good as ever, a new threat has arisen in the East. A good Emperor will need to concentrate much of his military might - including the fearsome kataphraktoi against the emerging threat of the Seljuk Turks. At the same time, he must also be aware of other opportunities: the Balkans, the Holy Land and North Africa. A maritime strategy controlling the Mediterranean can pay dividends. Finding common cause with one of the Catholic princes of the west is also, for example, a viable strategy, as neither side will necessarily want to eventually conquer the same territory. And an Emperor who can harness the power of western Crusaders can also profit from their work in weakening his enemies."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_EGYPTIAN_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Egyptians is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"At this starting date the Egyptians have a strong strategic position. Egypt itself has the potential to generate tremendous wealth, and both nearby foes - the Almohads and the Turks - are co-religionists and may move against other, non-Islamic factions. The Egyptians also field a significant number of exclusive and uncommon units in their armies, such as the Mamluks. They also have the potential to field the first gunpowder weaponry in the Mediterranean world. But Egyptian victory requires more than simply hanging on and waiting for enemies to destroy each other."} 
@{"The ruling Islamic, Fatimid dynasty in Egypt has been blessed in many ways. The heartland of the their domain remains as rich and fertile as ever, thanks to yearly flooding by the renewing Nile. The great cities along the riverbanks are some of the most sophisticated, wealthy and vibrant in the Known World. This is partly due to the Greek and Roman culture that the Fatamids inherited, but it has been transformed by their Arabic influence into something richer: a truly enlightened and erudite culture."}
@{"The Islamic rulers of Egypt are also tolerant to a degree not seen elsewhere: Jews, Orthodox Christians, Coptic Christians and many other sects are allowed to worship as they will, although they are excluded from certain government posts. This gives the dynasty an underlying strength and popularity that stands it in good stead to meet the future."}
@{"Egypt does face external threats, but should be well placed to meet them. There is an expansionist tendency in western, Catholic Christianity that could lead to trouble.  Future Islamic control of the eastern Mediterranean could be challenged, and this has long been encouraged by the Byzantine Empire to the north. There is always the chance that the Byzantine Empire will seek to re-establish direct control over its former possessions. In addition, the Almohads to the west do not demonstrate the friendliness that should become fellow Muslims, and the same is sometimes true of the Turks in the near east. Providing that each of these challenges can be met, there is plenty to look forward to as a ruler of Egypt - the wealth of the Mediterranean and Islamic worlds is there for the taking!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ENGLISH_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the English in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The English start with the advantage of a good strategic position. If the British Isles can be conquered, there are few direct threats to English security, but expansion is continually hampered by the presence of the French, an enemy both rich and powerful. English armies have no special advantages, but can eventually include two exclusive troop types: Longbowmen and Billmen. Although not immediately available Longbowmen, and particularly Longbowmen trained in Wales, are war-winning units. Billmen are less dramatic, although the ability to field a kind of halberdier earlier than other factions should not be undervalued!"}
@{"By 1087 England is, for the most part, firmly in the control of its Norman overlords. The King, his courtiers and the great lords are all French-speaking Normans, and most hold lands on both sides of the English Channel. England is only one part of a larger, Norman domain but is increasingly wealthy due to the wool trade. The King's holdings in France, it has to be said, are far more valuable than his English provinces."}
@{"This basic position on both a defensible island and on the continent brings opportunities and problems for an English King. The kingdom is sprawling and not always easy to defend at every point. There are also political considerations: thanks to ancient oaths of fealty, the English King is nominally a vassal of the French King. This status is ignored by English Kings as a matter of course, but is a bone of contention with France. The English ambition to gain land and power at the expense of France is another issue in the two nations' intertwined histories. The English kings are, of course, Catholic, but they are not above struggles with Rome over who controls the Church in England, a struggle that has still to be played out to a conclusion. That said, the Kings of England are largely pious and god-fearing."}
@{"As always, when looking to expand, the English must look both close to home and across the seas to France. With holdings in France an attack there can look tempting, but any English ruler who doesn't keep an eye on Scotland at the same time is asking for trouble. Scotland, Wales and Ireland can be subdued first, but it is likely to be at a high cost in blood and treasure. In turn, this risks an attack by the French. And once conquered, new lands will need to be firmly occupied. All that said, the English have Norman vigour and a growing sense of national identity to bind them together under a strong war leader. They have the potential to flower into a great western empire."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_FRENCH_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the French is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The French position is not an easy one, as they are hemmed in by both the English and the Holy Roman Empire, and winning as the French requires not only hanging on to what is already French, but aggressive conquest too. French armies have no exclusively French specialist troops, so they are slightly disadvantaged in this respect. They do (eventually) have an advantage when training Chivalric Knights (especially in Toulouse), giving them some of the finest (if sometimes wayward and impetuous) heavy cavalry in the world. French crossbowmen are also better than average. Finally, Crusades are a valuable tool for French expansion, if properly organised, resourced and targeted."}
@{"At first glance, the position of the French King looks unenviable. His centre of power around Paris and the Ile-de-France looks small and vulnerable, and the great nobles often openly flout his authority. That these great nobles also nominally include the King of England is no comfort either. In French eyes, the English Kings may be vassals in France, but in fact they act like unwelcome masters in much of the land. The King of France has no real authority in what should be his own domain where the English are concerned. Sooner or later, this problem will have to be addressed and settled once and for all."}
@{"Until then, France must contend with a potentially aggressive neighbour to the north, the Holy Roman Empire to the east, the relatively weak Christian kingdoms of Spain to the south, and Italy. After the English, the Holy Roman Empire is the greatest rival, particularly if the Emperor harbours ambitions of conquering Italy. If possible, expansion into northern Italy represents a good way of securing French glory and thwarts Imperial ambitions. This is particularly true if relations with the Catholic Church become strained. A French army in Rome is a powerful argument when dealing with the Papacy, but provokes religious discontent by its presence."}
@{"If all this paints a bleak picture of French prospects, things are not quite as bad as they appear. France is a very rich country and can have more-than-ample resources to draw upon. Once the French king has spent wisely and secured his heartlands, an enemy could have a difficult time in taking them, especially against the flower of French knighthood. And when waging a war of aggression, France has the same advantages: in honour and nobility, those same French knights are the envy of the world! Above all, France must avoid expansion (and therefore warfare) in too many places at the same time. War against the English must not allow the Empire to nibble away at French possessions, and vice versa. France has the power to prosper mightily, but only when this power is used carefully."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the (German) Holy Roman Empire in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The Holy Roman Empire at this early start date presents problems and opportunities. The size of the Empire itself is something of a problem, as it is not quite large enough to completely dominate the continent. There are potential enemies on all sides too. The Empire has to both hang on to what it already has and pursue a process of aggressive conquest against each of its enemies in turn. The Empire's (almost) exclusive troops appear relatively late in the game, but they are worth the wait. Gothic Knights, particularly from Saxony, are among the most powerful armoured cavalry available to any faction, and Gothic sergeants are equally good for their class. Crusades too can be a powerful weapon for the Empire."}
@{"Although apparently surrounded by rivals and subject to internal dissent, the Holy Roman Empire is not the weakling power it might seem. The Emperor is the overlord - for the most part - of vast tracts of Germany and beyond, but his need to keep dissent and disloyalty under control can be a limitation on his power. Few within the Empire feel loyalty to anything beyond their immediate locality, making effective Imperial government almost the same as Imperial military occupation. Added to this is a rivalry with the Pope over who holds the ultimate authority within the Empire: Emperors have created their own Popes and then been excommunicated by the same men!"}
@{"If, however, the Emperor succeeds in keeping his provinces in line, his powers for further conquest are formidable indeed. Any new lands he takes only add to his power and can, with careful management, eventually be more loyal to the idea of 'the Empire' than the older Imperial provinces inside Germany."}
@{"A drive to the east against Poland can give easy pickings providing care is taken. The Poles can have problems of their own on their eastern frontiers, and judicious pressure from Germany can yield real gains. A move to the southeast is possible, into the Balkans and towards the Black Sea, brushing aside or absorbing the petty kingdoms there. To the south, the rich provinces of the Italian peninsular are a temptation with an additional bonus in controlling Rome and thus influencing the Papacy, although this has the risk of causing religious unrest. To the west, the French are often distracted by their wars with England. The Empire, however, needs to avoid war against more than one opponent at a time. A central position may allow the Emperor to strike out in any direction, but he can also be attacked anywhere along his borders."}
@{"Finally, no Emperor should overlook the possibilities for power presented by a Crusade when the Pope calls for one. Who is to say what lands might be available in the wake of such an endeavour?"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ITALIAN_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Italians in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"Hemmed in by other factions, the Italians need to choose their enemies with care. While the lands of the Papacy may seem like tempting targets on the way to uniting the Italian peninsular, the unique status of the Papacy itself makes it an almost-impossible opponent to completely eradicate. The Italians have only one exclusive unit, Italian Light Infantry, but they are one of the two factions that can eventually train Gothic Knights and Gothic Sergeants - among the most effective units available to western Christian factions. They also have the potential to train superior handgunners and arquebusiers, and in Tuscany at least to train Urban Militia of a higher than average standard."}
@{"The Italians are blessed with rich lands, industry and wealth from trade besides. Much of Europe's wealth flows into Italy and the coffers of the Pope, and much of his wealth then flows out into the hands of Italian merchants. All of this gives Italy's rulers a chance to become great, for as the Roman writer Cicero put it: "nervos belli, pecuniam infinitam" (the sinews of war, unlimited money). They are also blessed with a warlike and adventurous nature, which can make them a difficult people to rule at times. There is also the ever-present problem of Rome and the Papacy: religion and religious feeling can work both for and against rulers."}
@{"Opportunities come in many guises for a bold Italian ruler. To the northwest the French hold on their southern provinces is not always as secure as the northern French kings would wish; religious and secular differences can mean that France has problems with its own people even while it is struggling against English expansionism. To the north, Imperial power can slip or fail. To the east, the Balkans can be a tempting potential empire for Italy. And there is always the prospect of becoming a naval power. Perhaps, in the long term, domination of the Mediterranean offers the best chance of Italian supremacy. True, the great powers of the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic kingdoms will have to be challenged for naval and mercantile supremacy. With the wealth of Mediterranean trade at his disposal and his home provinces secured, any Italian ruler should be able to expand his holdings."}
@{"All of these strategies have their risks. The same wealth that helps Italy also makes it an attractive target to others. Both the French King and the Emperor may not be able to resist meddling in Italy, or even mounting a full-scale invasion. Competing at sea means taking power that the Byzantines may consider to be rightfully theirs, or may weaken the Byzantines so that they no longer form a bulwark against future Islamic expansion. But if Italy benefits from all these machinations and from a Crusade or two..."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_POLISH_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Polish is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Polish position is not an easy one to convert into outright victory. There are easy pickings nearby, but these have to be taken quickly. Time is not an ally, as both the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary to the west and Novgorod to the east can both quickly expand until their borders are in direct contact with Polish territory. At this point, war on many fronts is likely. The Poles have only one exclusive unit, Polish Retainers, and these are not immediately available. They can, however, have access to both specialised troops from nearby provinces, such as Lithuanian Cavalry and Woodsmen, and most of the troops available to other Catholic factions."}
@{"In the last century Poland has profited from the weakness of its neighbours and its strong relationship with the Empire and the Papacy, even though it is only a little over 100 years since Christianity became the religion of its rulers and the pagan ways were abandoned. Polish Grand Dukes swore fealty to the Empire and even made their country subordinate to the Pope in the recent past. Polish military strength has now brought about a break with the Empire, and the independent Polish kings rule in their own right. The borders of the kingdom of Poland are not, however, set in stone - both opportunity and danger wait on all sides."}
@{"There is opportunity all around in the petty principalities and dukedoms that owe allegiance to no strong central kingdom, and in the lands of the lesser kingdoms too. With no central authority, these smaller powers can easily fall before an aggressive, organised attack, and a cunning Polish King can take advantage of his smaller neighbours' weaknesses. Even the sanction of Mother Church can be relied upon at times for these actions, as there are still many places where pagans can be found, their souls ripe for salvation through conquest. To the east and northeast the people are fierce, but not so organised as in the west. To the west, the pickings are richer but the risks are greater, especially as this is likely to bring Poland into direct competition with Imperial power in central Germany."}
@{"And Imperial power can be a problem, especially any Imperial plans for expansion if the Emperor is checked or chooses not to move south or westwards. A wise Polish ruler will realise that he may not be able to defeat the Empire, but he can certainly make it too expensive in blood and treasure for the Imperial army to advance into Poland or keep what it takes for very long."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_SPANISH_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Spanish is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Spanish position is a difficult one, hemmed in by mountains, independent rebels, the Aragonese and the Almohads. Early expansion somewhere is vital, and the fall of every independent province to a rival in the Iberian peninsular weakens the Spanish position. Spanish military forces are much as those of other Catholic powers - their heavy specialised cavalry such as Lancers and Gendarmes are quite late developments and not exclusive to the Spanish. They do have exclusive access to the Knights of Santiago, units that only become available after a successful Crusade. And thanks to geographical restrictions, they can train units of Spanish Jinettes. These light cavalrymen can give unsuspecting opponents a nasty surprise!"}
@{"The Christian kings of Spain are not the only claimants to the lands south of the Pyrenees. The Islamic rulers of the Almohad Caliphate possess much of the peninsular, and are seen as blood enemies by the Spanish. Almost driven from their lands by the Almohads, the Spanish have clung grimly to their remaining provinces and fought back. The defence of Christian Spain has become a holy cause, as the Spanish see themselves as the defenders of Christendom in the west. Even so, they face a great and powerful enemy in the Almohads and one that is, by many standards, a good deal more advanced and civilized than they."}
@{"The defeat of the Almohad Caliphate must be the priority for any Spanish King. Unless the Almohads are driven from Spanish soil, they will always be a threat, just by their presence. Peaceful co-existence may be possible for a while, but long term it is an illusion. Catholic Spain and Islamic Spain want the same lands and the same souls, and the Catholic Kings of Spain should be in no mood for compromise. To date, they have not been able to afford the luxury of tolerance, and are unlikely to be able to do so in future. The Spanish can harness their vigorous faith in pursuit of victory, but the Almohads will have to be worn down on many battlefields to secure a Spanish homeland. If this is not done too many resources and men will have to be committed to defensive garrisons to allow new conquests to be made."}
@{"Bringing all of Spain back into the Catholic fold may be greatness enough for some but once it is done further expansion is possible. Any invasion into southern France is across rugged and inhospitable terrain, and will require a Spanish King's undivided attention, but with experienced troops it could be done. It could also be advantageous for Spain if the French and English have already bled each other dry too."}
@{"The Spanish rarely have military power to spare for Crusades towards the east and the Holy Land unless they have defeated the Islamic princes closer to home. But Crusades can also be a powerful tool in this domestic struggle; a mighty weapon indeed, but the consequences of a Crusade can also be terrible and unpredictable."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_TURKISH_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Turks is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Turks have a difficult starting position simply because, from early in the game, they will have to enter into a major war against either the Byzantine Empire or the Egyptians. Unless either of these opponents falls into anarchy there are no easy pickings to be made. Expansion means taking someone else's lands. As if to compensate for this difficult starting position the Turks have one of the more interesting unit rosters, with many units that are exclusively Turkish. Some of these, such as the Janissaries, emerge late in the game, but the Turks also have a fine selection of cavalry and horse archers."}
@{"The Turks are a warlike people, and justifiably proud of their martial skills. Once steppe warriors in the service of Muslim princes further to the east, they have now become Muslim princes themselves thanks to these same war skills. They have carved out a sultanate that not only challenges the power of Byzantium but also dominates the approaches to the Holy Land and the valuable trade routes through the Levant. This rise to power has not been without its internal conflicts, but succession crises have been weathered and the Turkish sultanate has always emerged the stronger. The Turkish position is enviable and ripe for expansion, but it is not without attendant risks."}
@{"Firstly, the Orthodox Christians of the Byzantine Empire can represent Islamic Turkish expansion as not just a threat to their own power and prestige, but as an attack on Jerusalem, the destination for Christian pilgrims. This can bring western adventurers and Crusaders to the Middle East, intent on destroying Turkish power. Secondly, there is Byzantium itself. Although the Empire has been in decline, there is nothing to say that it must remain so. An able Byzantine Emperor could easily marshal enough resources to attack and defeat the Turks! A wise Sultan keeps his armies ready for war, even when not contemplating immediate expansion."}
@{"But the potential is there: the rich and tempting provinces of the Byzantine Empire are now vulnerable to attack after long years of decadence, and beyond them is the greatest prize of all: the city of Constantinople and its untold riches. Beyond that are the petty principalities of the Balkans. A Turkish Sultan could one day rule his own lands and much of Europe too! The Holy Land and far-off Egypt also beckon, if the fury of the Christian, Catholic west (as their holy places are conquered or threatened) can be withstood."}

// Faction descriptions - High Era

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ALMOHAD_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Almohad Caliphate is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Almohad Caliphate is a faction with some strengths at this starting date, making it one of the easier factions in the game to command. Its troops, such as Berber Camels (exclusively available to the Almohads), are forces that can be very useful against the weaker opponents encountered in early battles, but in the longer term the Almohad's strengths in militia and lightweight forces may be a slight handicap. The Caliphate may look as if it could be crushed on two fronts, but this is not quite so straightforward. The Spanish and Aragonese can be troublesome, but the Egyptians may well have problems of their own."}
@{"The Almohad Caliphate includes North African coastal lands and a large part of the Spanish peninsula. Coming from a desert people, the Berber tribesmen of the Almohad dynasty conquered North Africa and then took Spain from its Islamic princes while supposedly helping them. The Almohads never enjoyed lax morality and easy living, and so have ruled their lands with a rod of iron. The Khalifah's rule has kept his subject Christians and Jews under control, although this is now just as much a reflection of the intolerant attitudes shown by the Kings of Spain towards their Islamic and Jewish subjects."}
@{"Catholic strength in Spain is a problem that needs addressing by the Almohads. Their domain has always been the target for the Spanish who are intolerant of Islam, and they have been slowly driven south. As a consequence, Almohad policy must be a concentration of effort against further Spanish attacks. Unless the Spanish are checked there can be no revival in Almohad fortunes, as the Iberian peninsular provinces are the richest in their empire. The Almohads still have considerable strength: their government is efficient; their military skills are formidable; and their troops have few equals in open battle when handled well, being as fanatical and brave as any Christian "crusader"."}
@{"If the Almohads rise to meet the immediate challenges they face, then they can be a power in the Mediterranean world and beyond. The Spanish are not unbeatable (their own internal problems are great), and beyond them the French and English are still at each other's throats. Both the Christian provinces of Spain and the southern lands of France present rich pickings, and simply reaching the Pyrenees would give the Khalifah's armies a natural defensive line to hold. Across the sea, the southern Italian provinces could also be rich targets, although a direct threat to Rome could unite Catholic forces. Along the north African coast, Egyptian lands may also be vulnerable as the rulers of Egypt are likely to be distracted by Crusaders in the Holy Lands and the possibility of a resurgent Byzantine Empire."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_BYZANTINE_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Fairly Hard. Playing the Byzantines in this period is a little harder than the difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"At the start of play the Byzantine Empire has just suffered a terrible blow, and lost control of Constantinople to western Crusaders - although thieves is a better description! The Empire is still important, but as Constantinople is the key to real Byzantine power and wealth it is severely hampered in what it can do. The Empire has access to many exclusive units, including the supremely heavy Kataphraktoi cavalry, but again the loss of Constantinople has slowed the process of building an army. And the units in that army are now looking slightly old fashioned, but do not confuse this with obsolete. A Byzantine leader must also consider using money and cunning in place of swords to achieve every victory."}
@{"In the last 100 years or so, the Byzantine Empire has seen its power and influence slowly decline. By the standards of any other Christian land, Byzantium is still fabulously rich, its people heirs to the imperial greatness of Rome. But disaster has struck in the last year: Constantinople has fallen to a so-called crusader army, made up of ambitious and greedy men who should have been fighting Byzantium's enemies. Instead, they took the city as their own, installed a usurping "Latin Emperor", and the rightful Emperor now lives in exile!"}
@{"Although much wealth was plundered when Constantinople was taken, what is left to the Empire still attracts the envy of others. Trade has enriched the Imperial coffers with taxes and bribes, and Byzantine coinage remains universally acceptable. Constantinople (or Byzantium) itself, founded as the second Rome by Constantine the Great, is still the greatest city in Europe, even under the false Latin Emperor. Its walls still look impregnable, the people almost impossibly wealthy and cultured."}
@{"The Byzantine Empire has its share of other problems, beyond simply losing the capital city. Its mercenary armies are no longer quite as formidable as they were and are expensive, but they provide a measure of security. Its ancient frontiers have been broken and overrun, but there is still some maritime greatness. Crusaders from the west have not added to the security of the Empire - they are little better than pillaging barbarians, even if they have diverted Islamic attentions away from the Byzantines. The Pope in Rome and the Byzantine patriarchs are still at loggerheads, however, even in the face of Islamic expansionism."}
@{"From the east and south, the Turkish and Arabic powers threaten to take still more territory. But there is now the possibility of allying with one of the Islamic powers that do not see eye-to-eye on many matters, and using them to strike down their fellow Muslims. All that said, the apparent Byzantine weakness hides an inner strength and a will to survive and thrive. The Empire need not fail, as long as it is under the command of the right Emperor."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_DANISH_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Danes is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."}
@{"The Danes have a hard starting position because their expansion potential is severely curtailed by the Holy Roman Empire. Unless the Empire falls into anarchy or goes to war against several opponents the Danes can have a hard time gaining any new lands, other than probably taking the Scandinavian provinces. While the Danes do have exclusive access to Vikings and Longboats, both of these will become outmoded as play progresses - this is not to say that they are useless, merely that they will become obsolescent. Winning as the Danes will require aggression and the ability to seize chances."}
@{"The lands of the north are bleak and uncompromising, but they have always produced superlative fighting men. The Vikings, the Normans, the Rus and even the Varangian Guard in far-off Byzantium are all Norsemen of one sort or another. As navigators, traders and warriors, Norsemen have few rivals in the world, although their raiding voyages are now nearly at an end. Denmark is established as the strongest of the Scandinavian kingdoms, having crushed the pagan Wends in northern Germany and their own pagans in the wilder lands to the north. The kings of Denmark have also cleverly avoided being absorbed into the Empire as just one more province, even though they have had Imperial support in the past."}
@{"With a partly secure power base, the Danes can do well if they avoid being overrun by Imperial forces outside Scandinavia. Their position at the mouth of the Baltic makes development as a maritime power an attractive, and possibly vital, option. If the Baltic can be controlled, then Danish armies can move at will to any point along the coast, creating enclaves of Danish power to the east. The smaller, independent duchies and principalities can be picked off and then used to expand Danish power further along the northern periphery of Eastern Europe. This may be a continuation of the Viking era, but the intention is to hold what is invaded rather than simply despoil the land. It can bring a Danish ruler into competition with Poland, Russia and the Empire, as these kingdoms may be trying to acquire the same lands on the Baltic coast. Southern expansion into the rich provinces of central and western Germany is also an option for a strong Danish ruler, but one that must be carefully timed to avoid an Imperial backlash. It is a strategy that works well when Imperial authority has collapsed, as the resources of an angered Emperor are likely to be great indeed."}
@{"Finally, it is only two centuries ago that Danish rulers could also claim the kingship of England, before the coming of the Norman overlords (descendants of Vikings themselves) who now rule there. Perhaps these old claims could be renewed, and a new maritime kingdom across the Northern seas could be created. Wherever a ship can go there could be a way for the Danish to make a profit - or a killing!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_EGYPTIAN_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Egyptians is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"At this starting date the Egyptians have a strong strategic position. Egypt itself has the potential to generate tremendous wealth, and both nearby foes - the Almohads and the Turks - are co-religionists and may move against other, non-Islamic factions. This is the height of the crusading era, so intervention by Catholic westerners is also highly likely. Egyptian victory, however, will require more than just defence. The Egyptians also field a significant number of exclusive and uncommon units in their armies, such as the Mamluks. They also have the potential to field the first gunpowder weaponry in the Mediterranean world in the shape of Mamluk Handgunners."} 
@{"The Islamic rulers of Egypt have been blessed like the Pharaohs of old by the Nile, which makes the heartland of their domains a rich and fertile place. The great cities of the Nile valley are some of the oldest, most sophisticated and wealthy in the world, thanks in part to the survival of Greek and Roman culture. This learning, however, has been transformed into a distinctly enlightened Arabic form by the influence of ideas from Baghdad and further east. Merchants of all kinds have travelled the same routes as knowledge, and brought back wealth too."}
@{"Until recently, the Egyptian sultans were very tolerant rulers, but they are becoming more militaristic in their outlook. Orthodox Christians, Jews, Coptic Christians, even Catholics and Christian heretic sects are allowed to worship as they wish, but are excluded almost without exception from power. This gives the domain an underlying strength and unity in its Islamic government that stands it in good stead to meet the future. They have a powerful army, including Mamluk slave warriors, and it is a force with few equals in the Christian world where battlefield discipline is concerned."}
@{"External threats and opportunities are two sides of the same coin. There are still the Catholic powers to be concerned about, disguised as their ambitions may be by a veneer of religion. The Almohads to the west are under pressure in Spain and may yet abandon their European lands; and cornered men are often at their most dangerous, striking out at anyone near at hand. Egypt may be vulnerable to an attack along the North African coast. The Turks continue to press forwards, and may choose to advance towards Cairo rather than Constantinople, so then an alliance with the Byzantine Empire could prove profitable. And across the Mediterranean in southern Europe, Italian factionalism presents an opportunity to snatch new lands, alongside the threat of a new maritime power. Providing that each of these challenges can be met, there is plenty to look forward to as a ruler of Egypt - the wealth of the Mediterranean and much of the Islamic world is there for the taking!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ENGLISH_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the English in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The English start with the advantage of a good strategic position. With the British Isles taken, there is a secure homeland, but expansion and victory will demand confrontation at some point with the French. English armies have no special advantages, but can include two exclusive troop types: Longbowmen and Billmen. At this time Longbowmen can be a battle-winning force. Billmen are less dramatic, although the ability to field a kind of halberdier earlier than other factions should not be undervalued! And the English also have the chance to use Crusades as a tool to further their ambitions."}
@{"In 1205 England is a land with potential greatness, but one that has suffered hard knocks in the previous decades and seen its power diminished. The English still have the potential to become a great continental power, uniting the home islands and France beneath a single crown. This almost came about under Henry II fifty years ago, but since then his Angevin empire has been divided and lost."}
@{"England has become an island nation, but a potentially wealthy one (English wealth is based almost exclusively on its unglamorous but profitable wool trade). The fearsome Welsh longbow has begun to make its contribution to English armies too. The overseas holdings of the English Kings are much reduced, lost to the French in a series of disastrous bargains, wars and acts of foolishness. At one point almost masters in France, the English have been on the defensive for generations, holding on to the last valuable lands they own."}
@{"However, the English are now the master in their island home. The Welsh have been subdued, if not yet crushed; Wales still needs strong garrisons. Ireland too is an English possession, although this too needs a formidable garrison. The Scots can be contained, probably, and permanent conquest of Scotland (or dynastic chicanery to achieve the same ends) remains an English ambition, and one that could be fulfilled with sufficient effort."}
@{"Looking abroad, there are the lost French lands of the Angevin kings to re-conquer. The kingdom of France may now rule much of France, but any English king could - and should - make a good claim to rule on French soil. The few lands in France that remain are valuable in themselves, but also offer a toehold to launch an attack to retake what is rightfully English! And once conquered, these lands will need garrisons to protect them from inevitable French reprisals. This struggle for dominance with the French will need to be uppermost in any English ruler's mind, and guide his choice of allies in both the short and long term."}
@{"Overall, the English still represent a credible force in the race to become a power in western Christendom."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_FRENCH_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the French in this period is no harder or easier than the basic difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The French position cannot be described as easy at this start date, although their situation has eased compared to the early starting date. Winning as the French still requires hanging on to what is already French, and aggressive conquest of other provinces. The French have no exclusive troops, but do have an advantage when training Chivalric Knights (especially in Toulouse), giving them some of the finest heavy cavalry in the world for a time. French crossbowmen are also better than average. Finally, Crusades can still be a valuable tool for French expansion."}
@{"The star of French kings is definitely in the ascendant. They have done much in the last century to make France strong, and to secure her borders against foreign aggression. Thanks to English carelessness (and the power of French armies) some of the lands that had English overlords are now back in French hands. The French nobility are still intractable and wilful, of course, and flout the King's authority at every opportunity, but the King's position is strong, his treasury wealthy and his prospects better than they have ever been."}
@{"The English, of course, still see much of France as their property and still want to be masters of the realm. The French must contend with this aggressive neighbour to the north, but can counter the English by conducting invasions of their own - the English cannot be strong everywhere! To the east, the Holy Roman Empire is less of a threat than it used to be, perhaps, as opportunities exist for an Imperial move eastwards rather than into France. Expansion into northern Italy still represents a good way of securing French glory, and may also thwart Imperial ambitions in that direction - and damage the Italians too! To the south, the Spanish are likely to be pre-occupied with their wars against the Almohads. The French do have some of the finest knights in the world at their disposal, but more than great valour may be required to win new glory for the crown!"}
@{"This all paints a rosy picture of French strengths and prospects, but a wise ruler knows to allow for contingencies. Spending wisely to secure what is already French is always a good strategy before mounting any expedition to take new lands. Religious differences can tear a realm apart as surely as any others, and the French need to be aware of this, as heresy is a cancer if not cut out. The Catholic Church, not always the easiest of allies, needs to be appeased, so the power and benefits of a Crusade are also things that a French monarch should bear in mind."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_GERMAN_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the (German) Holy Roman Empire in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The size of the Holy Roman Empire at this start date is something of a problem in itself, as it is not quite large enough to completely dominate the continent, but is certainly large enough to have pockets of disloyalty. There are potential enemies on all sides too. The Empire has to both hold what it already has and pursue a process of aggressive conquest against each of its rivals in turn. The Empire's (almost) exclusive troops appear relatively late in the game, but they are worth the wait. Gothic Knights, particularly from Saxony, are among the most powerful armoured cavalry available to any faction, and Gothic sergeants are equally good for their class. Crusades too can be a powerful weapon for the Empire."}
@{"Surrounded by rivals and subject to internal dissent, the Holy Roman Empire sometimes appears weak, a realm held together only by the most fragile of bonds. No one within the Empire really thinks of themselves as Imperial subjects - their loyalties are to the principality, the duchy, the free city, or even the village where they live. The Holy Roman Empire seems an ideal in the minds of men more than a physical reality, and in the hands of a weak leader it is sometimes barely this much. But under a strong Emperor, Imperial power can be awesome. The magnates can be forced to bow to Imperial authority, and once dissent and disloyalty are controlled great things can be achieved. The Empire can be held together by force of will and force of arms, and it can be made greater still by both of these."}
@{"Above all other strategic considerations, the Emperor must avoid war against more than one opponent at a time. His central position in Europe may allow attacks in any direction, and the Empire can be strongly defended against counterattacks, but a surrounded man is still surrounded, no matter how great his strength. Imperial power needs to be used against one opponent at a time, and Imperial diplomacy should be aimed at making sure enemies do not act in concert."}
@{"A drive to the east against Poland or Hungary can be profitable, although the warlike nature of these peoples should not be underestimated. Beyond is the space to expand almost at will. To the west, the French may be distracted by war with England, a long running rivalry that can be exploited. In the north, the Danes will need careful watching, intent as they are on creating their own empire. To the south, the rich provinces of the Italian peninsular are a temptation, and the long-running dispute with the Pope as to the nature of Papal authority may require an army to occupy Rome, even if this results in a religious backlash."}
@{"Finally, no Emperor should overlook the possibilities for power presented by a Crusade. Nothing lasting may yet have been achieved in the Holy Lands by Crusaders, but who is to say what benefits might be available to a cunning ruler in the wake of such an adventure?"}

@{"Although there are many nearby factions, the Italians need to choose their enemies with care - taking on the Papacy is neither easy nor wise. However, the Italians have been among the beneficiaries of the weakening of the Byzantine Empire by this date, and any advantage is useful. The Italians have only one exclusive unit, Italian Light Infantry, but they are one of the two factions that can eventually train Gothic Knights and Gothic Sergeants - among the most effective units available to western Christian factions. They also have the potential to train superior handgunners and arquebusiers, and in Tuscany at least to train Urban Militia of a higher than average standard."}
@{"Italy is blessed with rich farmlands, skilled craftsmen and cunning merchants. It is also cursed by the presence of rich farmlands, skilled craftsmen and cunning merchants, or at least by the desire that this wealth provokes in others. Much of the wealth of western and northern Europe flows into and through Italy, into the coffers of the pope and the banking houses of the cities and money can be converted into both military and political clout. The Italians are also blessed with an adventurous and sometimes warlike nature, one that makes them difficult, even rebellious, subjects at times but worthwhile soldiers in times of war."}
@{"There are opportunities on all sides for a skilled and resolute Italian leader. To the northwest the French are likely to be concentrating on their rivalry with England, or looking to the east and more Crusades. To the north the Swiss are defiantly independent and good soldiers to boot. Beyond them the Empire can be a tempting target should it fall into disorder. To the east, the fading power of Byzantium is still something to be treated with respect, but that respect need not be as boundless as it was once. The Byzantines have many problems of their own and may not be able to hold what is currently theirs in the Balkans. To the far south lie the Islamic lands across the Mediterranean. Invasion there would be difficult, and it is a wise Italian prince who remembers that an invasion force can come from the most inconvenient direction. The seas also offer the chance of maritime greatness: profitable trade and warfare can go hand in hand at sea."}
@{"Papal authority may also not be as solid as it was once upon a time, but it's always worth remembering that Italy, the home of the Papacy, is a tempting target for a strong Emperor. Heretical thought has been growing for many years over some of the Church's more dubious practices, such as selling absolution for sins, not to mention the Church's ever-increasing wealth. In many cases, this heresy is no more than a desire to return to simpler, less worldly religious practices. But there are heretics in northern Italy and in France who represent more of a threat to the established order, the Cathars among them. Although it could be a terrible risk, carrying excommunication and damnation as the price of failure, an Italian ruler could exploit these religious differences to his own ends."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Polish is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Polish position is not an easy one to convert into outright victory. There are some easy pickings nearby, but time is not an ally, as the Holy Roman Empire, the Hungarians and the Russians are all likely to be interested in the same provinces. At this point, war on many fronts is likely, and then there is the possibility of a Mongol invasion to consider. The Poles have only one exclusive unit, Polish Retainers, and other units will outclass these forces in the long term. They can, however, have access to specialised troops from nearby provinces, such as Woodsmen and Lithuanian Cavalry, along with most of the troops available to other Catholic factions."}
@{"After a century of expansion profiting from the weakness of its neighbours and its strong relationship with the Empire and the Papacy, Poland remains potentially strong, at least for the moment. The Polish monarchy has managed to hold onto many of its relatively new possessions and Polish military strength has allowed resistance to the demands of the Empire as the power relationship changed."}
@{"The borders of the kingdom of Poland are not, however, set in stone: both opportunity and danger wait on all sides. Primogeniture - inheritance by the first-born - is not practiced in Poland, and the division of lands between children in every generation can make it hard to keep a kingdom intact; there is a tendency for the King to be the first among equals compared to the nobility. Even with these problems, the neighbouring petty principalities and dukedoms could fall before an aggressive, organised attack, and a cunning Polish King could take advantage of his smaller neighbours' weaknesses. All around are potentially rich pickings but all have risks, especially any expansionary move that will bring Poland into competition with Imperial power in Germany. The Russian princes to the east are less of a threat, but there are new threats beyond them. The steppe peoples are on the move once again, and a Polish ruler who does not keep an eye on Russian ambitions and the steppes is foolish indeed! Equally foolish is to ignore the intentions of the Holy Roman Emperor should his desire for land lead him to look at Polish territory."}
@{"The Catholic Church remains strong in Poland, and a useful tool for its kings to exploit, as there are pagans and Orthodox Christians to the east as rivals and (potential) enemies. The support of Mother Church can be relied upon, as there are still many places within reach of Polish arms where souls are ripe for salvation through conquest."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_RUSSIAN_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Fairly Hard. Playing the Russians in this period is a little harder than the basic difficulty level for the campaign."}
@{"Overall, the Russian strategic position is quite strong and there are independent provinces that can be conquered with relative ease. In order to win, the Russians will have to be aggressive conquerors. However, the main threat to the Russians comes from their position in the east, and the arrival of the Mongol hordes. It will take skill to survive this onslaught. The Russians do have an exclusive unit in their armies, the Boyars, and these cavalrymen can be a very potent force, even if they may eventually be outclassed by other factions' cavalry."}
@{"Russia is a vast, hard land, hemmed in on one side by the relative might of Poland, and wide open on the other side, facing the endless steppes and whatever pagan barbarians emerge from the wilderness. Its winters are cruel, and its rulers in the city of Kiev are often the same. The princes of Kiev have withstood attacks by Bulgars, Pechenegs and Khazars, converted to the Orthodox faith and banished paganism from their lands. In defeating these enemies their military skills have been tested and proven, and new lands have been opened up thanks to those same warlike skills. Diplomatic finesse has also been present too: in the last century, the Kievan princes have sought links through marriage with ruling families in Norway, Hungary and even distant France. The Kievan Rus have also adopted the Orthodox faith without falling prey to excessive Greek influences from Byzantium."}
@{"The principality is, however, changing. Polish and German moves to the east mean that further expansion in that direction is likely to be difficult, but not necessarily impossible. Trade routes are also changing, although whether this is to Russia's profit or loss is yet to be become clear."}
@{"The princes of the Rus need to consider their options carefully. There are lands for the taking on many of their borders, but not all lands are equally valuable. The steppes are a land of huge distances and few villages. Looking to the west, Poland, Lithuania and Hungary lie across the shortest routes to central Europe. Along the Baltic coast, Danish ambitions may have to be countered, and to the south there is the imperial power of Byzantium to consider, and the growing power of the Turks, once steppe nomads and now a settled and civilized people."}
@{"Whatever a Russian prince decides, he needs to keep in mind the current crop of steppe nomads. The steppes seem to produce endless hosts of barbarians, and Russian lands are the first outposts of Orthodox Christianity against the pagan barbarians..."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_SPANISH_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Spanish in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The Spanish position is an interesting one, with two rivals close by: the Aragonese and the Almohads. Spanish military forces are much as those of other Catholic powers - their heavy specialised cavalry such as Lancers and Gendarmes are quite late developments and not exclusive to the Spanish. They do have exclusive access to the Knights of Santiago, units that only become available after a successful Crusade. The Spanish can also produce excellent Inquisitors in Castile. And thanks to geographical restrictions, they can train units of Spanish Jinettes almost immediately. These light cavalrymen can give unsuspecting opponents a nasty surprise!"}
@{"A century of warfare has not been enough to free all of Spain from its Almohad overlords and impose a new Catholic order on the country. The Kings of Spain still face a struggle to take all the lands south of the Pyrenees from their traditional blood enemies. It is true that there have been times of peace, but these have also been times of preparation for the next war and the next victory. The further expansion of Christian Spain rather than just its defence has taken on the air of a crusade for the Spanish, and the elimination of Islamic and non-Christian influences inside Spanish domains is now pursued with equal vigour."}
@{"Unless the infidels are driven from Spain, the Spanish will never feel entirely safe. Catholic Spain and Islamic Spain want the same land and the same souls, and Kings of Spain cannot and should not think of compromise. Intolerance is the policy of the state and the Church in Spanish lands, a means of securing loyalty through fear as well as faith."}
@{"Bringing Almohad lands into the Catholic fold may be greatness enough for some, but once it is done further expansion of the Spanish domain is possible. Any invasion into southern France is likely to be across rugged and inhospitable terrain, and this will require the nation's undivided attention. If the Almohads have not been defeated, too many men will be needed as garrisons to allow new conquests to be made, but successful warfare against the Almohads will also give the Spanish an experienced army, one that can be used for other conquests. With the French and English still locked in their long-running dispute and a rise in religiously inspired (and heretical) disloyalty in southern France, there is always the chance a Spanish kingdom with possessions to the north and south of the Pyrenees could be created, and perhaps even with lands in Italy as well."}
@{"There is, of course, always the chance to become involved in a Mediterranean struggle for new territory. Southern Italy can be vulnerable to invasion, especially if weakened by internal struggles, or if France or the Holy Roman Empire repeatedly invade the Italian peninsular from the north."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_TURKISH_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Turks is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Turks have a difficult starting position simply because, from early in the game, they will have to enter into a major war against either the Byzantine Empire or the Egyptians. Fortunately, the Byzantine Empire is weaker than it has ever been before. Unless either of these opponents falls into anarchy there are no easy pickings to be made. Expansion means taking someone else's lands. As if to compensate for this difficult starting position the Turks have one of the more interesting unit rosters, with many units that are exclusively Turkish. Some of these, such as the Janissaries, emerge late in the game, but the Turks also have a fine selection of cavalry and horse archers."}
@{"In the last hundred years the warlike Turks have carved away many of the lands of the Byzantine Empire and made them their own. They can be justifiably proud of their martial tradition and skills that have taken them from being steppe warriors to becoming mighty Muslim princes. The Sultanate is now a real challenger to the power of Byzantium, and one that might well bring about the collapse of that ancient empire sooner rather than later. The ruling clan, the Seljuks, command armies that are both skilled and disciplined, the second quality being somewhat lacking in many Christian hosts. With their lands at the eastern end of the Mediterranean and towards the Black Sea, they now control the trading routes to the East and can tap the wealth that these generate. There are still disputes about the succession, but then the same could be said about any of the emerging nations of Europe and the Middle East."}
@{"The Turks are now a significant power in the eastern Mediterranean world. They dominate the approaches to the Holy Land and can draw on significant reserves of manpower for their armies. These hosts are far more disciplined than any Western army, well able to defend the sultanate's frontiers and push forward into disputed lands. These armies will be needed as Christian Crusaders remain a potent and seemingly irrational threat, and Byzantine encouragement of further Crusades is directly aimed at weakening Turkish power and influence. That the last of the Crusaders have been driven from the Holy Land (even though the Egyptian Sultan now rules there) should not be seen as proof that they cannot return to cause mischief. So a wise sultan keeps his armies ready for war, even when not contemplating immediate expansion."}
@{"The Turks, however, can afford to look beyond their immediate challenges and consider their ambitions for new territory. To the west, the Byzantine Empire stands as a shadow of its former greatness, but still a rival that will need to be crushed. Unless the Byzantines are swept aside, any Turkish expansion will be severely constrained. Once the Byzantines are driven back, a secure way to the Mediterranean world is also secured, and this means a sea-road to the lands beyond. Although there are still crusading fanatics to be considered, political reality may now mean that alliances with Christian princes in the west are now possible. They too have ambitions that can be harnessed for Turkish purposes. To the south are the fellow Muslims of Egypt, rivals in power even though they share the Islamic faith. The frontier with Egypt will have to be somewhere, and a sensible Turkish Sultan will make sure that it is as far south as possible."}



// Faction descriptions - Late Era



@["FSM_faction_info_faction_BYZANTINE_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Byzantine Empire is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"By this late period, the Byzantine Empire is in decline and the situation is increasingly severe - but not yet terminal. Several of the outlying provinces are independent states, and the Emperor's word no longer has real power beyond the city walls of Byzantium. The Empire's armies are, relatively speaking, on the edge of obsolescence in equipment and tactics: 'quaint' rather than 'unique'. A Byzantine leader must now use money to make up the shortfall, and place an increasing reliance on mercenaries to carry out conquests."} 
@{"The last one hundred years have been both cruel and kind to the Byzantine Empire. The loss of Constantinople to the Latin Emperors - western, Catholic crusaders who treacherously turned on their fellow Orthodox Christians - marked the lowest point. The small "Byzantine" kingdom that survived this disaster looked like the very last flickering of Roman imperial power, and unlikely to stand for long before its many enemies. But victory, however improbable, can sometimes be snatched from the jaws of the most crushing defeat, and this is what has happened to the Byzantines! The Latin Emperors are gone, and once again an Orthodox Emperor rules in Byzantium. The Empire, however, is much reduced; its borders are closer to the city walls than they have ever been before."}
@{"The root cause of the crusaders' treachery was, of course, money. The wealth of Byzantium, even in these straightened circumstances, is still a matter of awe and wonder to many. Trade still passes through the city in abundance, even though the mercantile cities of northern Italy have taken much trade away. The city walls may no longer be completely impregnable, but they are still mighty. Byzantium might look like it is in the last stages of decline, but this is not necessarily the case: its armies could be mighty again, and wealth could once again flow in uncountable quantities."}
@{"The heirs of the Caesars still have a chance to renew their imperial glory. The Turks are still a threat, and fellow Christians can no longer be trusted as once seemed to be the case, but there is always the chance that another victory can be snatched, that the frontiers can be pushed back, and that Byzantium can live on more than just the memories of past glories. A bold Emperor can carve a new Empire out of the surrounding lands, and make his people great once more!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_DANISH_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Danes is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."}
@{"The Danes have a hard starting position because their ability to take new territory is curtailed by the Holy Roman Empire. Unless the Empire falls into anarchy or goes to war against several opponents the Danes can have a hard time gaining any new lands on the continent, other than probably taking the Scandinavian provinces. While the Danes do have exclusive access to Vikings and Longboats, both of these are outmoded as play begins at this date - this is not to say that they are useless, merely that they are on the edge of obsolescence. Winning as the Danes will require aggression and the ability to seize chances."}
@{"For most of the last century, Danish rulers have done well in extending their power across the northern lands of Europe and around the shores of the Baltic. They have also done well not to be overwhelmed by Imperial power and end up as simply another unhappy province in the Holy Roman Empire. Their Viking heritage has been incorporated into a feudal realm that is the equal of any other Christian kingdom in honour and prestige. There have been setbacks under recent rulers, but there is still an underlying strength to the kingdom. The bleak lands of the north still produce fine warriors: the Varangian Guard in far-off Byzantium still has Norsemen in its ranks!"}
@{"Denmark's strategic position remains potentially strong. Denmark also has the chance to become a strong maritime nation, controlling the northern seas and gaining trade wealth: an "empire of the north" around the Baltic and North Seas is there for the taking. Much of the Baltic coast has now been incorporated in one or other of the larger kingdoms but there are still independent duchies and principalities to be conquered. If a rival kingdom is already embroiled in war, the Danes may be able to overrun a coastal province or two. This can bring the Danes into a confrontation with Poland, Russia and the Holy Roman Empire, as these kingdoms may be trying to hold or take these same lands."}
@{"Southern expansion into the rich provinces of central and western Germany is also an option for a strong Danish ruler, but one that must be carefully timed. It is a strategy that works well when Imperial authority is weakened or has already collapsed, but the resources of a strong Emperor will be great indeed. There are also ancient ties across the North Sea in England that could be exploited too, should that kingdom show signs of weakness. Before the current Norman royal family (descendants of Vikings themselves) took control, Danish blood ran through the veins of English Kings."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_EGYPTIAN_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Egyptians is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"At this starting date the Egyptians have a strong strategic position. Egypt itself has the potential to generate tremendous wealth. The Almohads have lost most of the Iberian peninsular and are now less vigorous threat. The Crusader threat is also much reduced. Egyptian victory, however, will require more than just defence. The Egyptians field a significant number of exclusive and uncommon units in their armies, such as the Mamluks, including Mamluk Handgunners."} 
@{"Islamic Egypt has been blessed by the Nile. The homeland is a place where famine is rare; the great cities along the Nile are sophisticated, rich and among the oldest in the world. Thanks to merchants, knowledge and wealth have flowed into the cities in abundance. Learning is prized, from the old knowledge of the Romans and Greeks to the new wisdom of Arabia, India and the east."}
@{"The rulers of Egypt, too, value Islamic learning and culture, if a little indirectly. It is less than 50 years since the Mamluks, the slave soldiers of the Ayyubid dynasty of the mighty Saladin, overthrew their masters and became the new rulers of Egypt. The Mamluks were and are warriors, and they leave the day-to-day management of their lands to functionaries, content as long as taxes are raised to pay for military adventures. Warfare is their chief pursuit, and the Mamluks are very good at making war."}
@{"Mamluk Egypt's opportunities and problems are two sides of the same coin. Although Catholic princes still talk of crusades, there seems to be little to fear from that direction, although the rise of powerful Christian kingdoms should never be entirely ignored. To the west, the Almohads are a people in decline and face serious problems in Spain, but cornered men can often be dangerous as well as vulnerable. The Turks continue their steady, relentless advance against the Byzantine Empire and this may occupy their entire attention, perhaps allowing Egyptian gains along their borders. An alliance with the Byzantine Empire, for example, may also help keep the Turks' attentions on Constantinople rather than Cairo. Across the Mediterranean, an alliance with Catholic Spain is unlikely, but interests are equally unlikely to clash. However, growing Italian mercantile and maritime ambitions could well have to be countered."}
@{"With a little planning, and with Egypt's reliable military strength, there is much to look forward to as ruler of this domain. The wealth of the Mediterranean and much of the Islamic world is there for the taking!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ENGLISH_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the English in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The English start with the advantage of a good strategic position, although admittedly they have never been so weak on the continental mainland. There is a secure homeland, but expansion and victory will always demand confrontation with the French. English armies have no special advantages, but can include two exclusive troop types: Longbowmen and Billmen. Longbowmen, especially Welsh Longbowmen, can be a battle-winning force. Billmen are less dramatic, although the ability to field a kind of halberdier earlier than other factions should not be undervalued."}
@{"Over the last century or so English kings have had mixed fortunes. The current ruler, Edward II, faces the hostility of the great nobles at every turn. Poorly considered disputes with the Papacy, fellow monarchs and great lords at home have all weakened the throne considerably. The English, for example, are a pious people and the Kings have suffered accordingly when going against papal authority. The Magna Carta has, in theory, made the King subject to the rule of law in the same way as his subjects, limiting his freedom to govern as he sees fit. England has also changed at the lower levels of society. A new class of petty landowners has come into being, the yeomen. There are still poor farmers, of course, but the yeomen have added greatly to the wealth of the country, and in parallel with their rising wealth they have greater expectations and pride in their new status. They are far less willing to submit meekly to their social betters, as once would have been the case. The loyalty of Englishmen and their willingness to pay taxes at the whim of the King can no longer be counted upon!"}
@{"Even with these concerns, England is wealthy and relatively well governed. The Welsh and Irish are, for the most part, safely subdued. Scotland remains the thorn in English flesh, one that will always need careful attention. All English Kings still hope for the uniting of the English and French crowns - worn, of course, by an Englishman. These ambitions are not as hopeless as they might seem for, although the old Angevin lands are gone, England may still have strength enough to conquer what her Kings claim in France. In turn, the French extend their claim of feudal sovereignty beyond the old English holdings in France to English holdings in England! It is not so many years since French soldiers harried the south coast of England. This continuing struggle for dominance with the French will need to be uppermost in any English ruler's mind, and guide his choice of allies."}
@{"Overall, the English position has promise. The strengths of the country have been ill served, under-used and squandered, but the potential for greatness under a strong leader is very real."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_FRENCH_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the French is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"The French position at this late start date has been eased by the reduction in English fortunes. Winning as the French still requires hanging on to what is already French, and aggressive conquest of further provinces. The French have no exclusive troops, but do have an advantage when training Chivalric Knights (especially in Toulouse), giving them some of the finest heavy cavalry in the world for a time. French crossbowmen are also better than average."}
@{"The last century has been kind to France. French Kings have become the masters in their own kingdom, put their government on a sound financial and administrative footing (something vital to the future health of the realm) and have developed a close relationship with the Papacy. Some would describe this as a domination of the Papacy, even though the Pope is not actually "imprisoned" on French soil. It was partly this influence that allowed the French monarchy to turn on the Knights Templar, accuse them of heresy, strip them of their accumulated wealth and lands and then destroy the crusading order, sending their Templars' Grand Master to the stake."}
@{"Rivalry with England is still central in all French policy, as it has to be to keep the English at bay and off-balance. Although related by marriage to the Kings of England, French rulers rightly have little love for their northern neighbours and treat them with suspicion and hostility, although this is sometimes cloaked beneath soft words! The English would still like to recover their former lands in France; the French cannot allow this, as they would be tenants in their own homes if such a disaster came to pass. To the south, there is the chance to meddle in the affairs of Italy and Spain: driving out the Muslims could easily allow new French possessions beyond the Pyrenees if the Spanish grow careless. To the east and in Italy the Holy Roman Empire is both a threat and an opportunity. A misstep by the Emperor may allow the French to expand their possessions; a strong Emperor bears careful watching."}
@{"In short then, France's position in the world is enviable: its farmlands are rich, its merchants wealthy, its monarchy secure and strong, its royal armies valorous and unmatched in honour. A wise ruler knows to allow for contingencies and secure his own lands before coveting new possessions, but the prospects for the future are excellent."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_GERMAN_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the (German) Holy Roman Empire in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The Holy Roman Empire is surrounded by rival factions, and its size is both a source of strength and potential rebellion. The Empire has to both hold what it already has and pursue a process of aggressive conquest against each rival in turn. The Empire's (almost) exclusive troops appear relatively late in the game, but they are worth the wait. Gothic Knights, particularly from Saxony, are among the most powerful armoured cavalry available to any faction, and Gothic sergeants are equally good for their class. Crusades too can be a powerful weapon for the Empire."}
@{"Over the last century the Holy Roman Emperors have been remarkable and insignificant in turn. One Emperor managed to get himself excommunicated no fewer than three times, was crowned King of Jerusalem (against the wishes of the Church), "forgot" his promises to go on Crusades, and even made an alliance with the Islamic Egypt! For nineteen years there were two Emperors, both so unimportant that the throne had to be considered empty. But most importantly of all, there has been an end to the Hohenstaufen dynasty and the Hapsburgs are the new Imperial family."}
@{"The Hapsburgs' holdings and family connections are what now give strength to the title of Emperor. The family are masters at the art of dynastic marriage: few opportunities to extend Hapsburg lands by treaty and marriage are ever ignored! And the lands they gain are held and rarely allowed to leave family control. The Holy Roman Empire may not have the power that it once possessed, but the Hapsburg Emperor is a powerful man in Europe. His lands, wealth and armies are the envy of other monarchs. Even the disapproval of the French-influenced Papacy has not been enough to cause him problems."}
@{"Disloyalty still plagues the Empire as its principalities, duchies and free cities all pursue their own policies, but a strong Emperor can overcome these obstacles. In central Europe there are lands to be secured against regional rebels. As long as the homelands of the Empire are secure, there are opportunities for war and diplomacy on all sides. French, Danish, Polish, Hungarian, and Italian lands can all be taken, provided that the other powers can be neutralised at least for the duration of a successful war. A sensible Emperor should always bear in mind that fighting on two borders at once means that Imperial power is, by definition, split. Imperial power, when it can be used against a single target, is crushing. And as long as Imperial diplomacy can keep enemies from uniting, military power can be used in just this fashion."}
@{"Finally, no Emperor should overlook opportunities for lasting alliances with kingdoms beyond his immediate neighbours. A counter-strategy of surrounding rivals by alliances or blood-relatives can be very successful in extending Hapsburg and Imperial influence."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ITALIAN_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Italians is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"Although there are many nearby factions, the Italians need to choose their enemies with care - taking on the Papacy is neither easy nor wise. The Italians have been beneficiaries of the failings of the Byzantine Empire. The Italians have only one exclusive unit, Italian Light Infantry, which is not a particularly powerful type on its own, but they are one of the two factions that can eventually train Gothic Knights and Gothic Sergeants - among the most effective units available to western Christian factions. They also have the potential to train superior handgunners and arquebusiers, and in Tuscany at least to train Urban Militia of a higher than average standard."}
@{"Italy is fortunate to have rich farmlands, skilled and industrious craftsmen and profit-hungry merchants. Much of Europe's wealth flows through Italian mercantile houses that are among the cleverest and most sophisticated in Europe. Italian cities are richer than almost any other Christian towns, rivalling Islamic cities (on a modest scale) with their culture and magnificence. In turn, this wealth is readily converted into political and military power. The Italians are an adventurous and occasionally warlike people: rebellious subjects at times but worthwhile soldiers in times of war."}
@{"There are opportunities and perils in unequal measure on all sides for a skilled and resolute Italian leader. To the northwest the French are likely to be concentrating on their rivalry with England. To the north the Swiss are defiantly independent, good soldiers and a valuable buffer against the Empire. Rome, of course, is the natural home of the Papacy, and this may make Italy a route for invasion by other powers intent on using military force for religious ends - Popes tend to be compliant when surrounded! To the east, Byzantium should still be treated with caution, but the days of automatic respect and awe are probably over, unless a strong Emperor emerges in Constantinople. The Byzantines have many problems of their own and may leave chances for an Italian domain to expand. To the south lie the Islamic domains on the far shore of the Mediterranean. Invasion in either direction would be difficult, but it is a wise Italian prince who remembers that an invasion force can come from the most inconvenient direction. But the seas also offer the chance of maritime greatness: profitable trade and warfare go hand in hand at sea."}
@{"Religion and politics also go hand in hand, and a resolute Italian leader may be able to exploit the confusion and problems in the Catholic Church. This could be a terrible risk, however, carrying excommunication and damnation as the price of failure!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_POLISH_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Polish is the equivalent of a harder difficulty setting than the one you chose."}
@{"The Polish position is a difficult one to convert into outright victory. There are few easy pickings nearby, and time is not an ally as others will be closing in on Polish borders. The Poles have only one exclusive unit, Polish Retainers, and other units will outclass these before long. They can, however, have access to specialised troops from nearby provinces, such as Woodsmen and Lithuanian Cavalry, along with most of the troops available to other Catholic factions."}
@{"Poland has survived a century of terrible dangers, none more terrible than the attack of the Mongols in 1241. An army of Polish and Teutonic knights was crushed, and the land was spared only when the Mongols miraculously turned, thanks to the death of their ruler through over-indulgence. Fortunately, these ravening monsters from the steppes have not attacked again. Instead, the Poles have been faced with threats from a different direction, as the Teutonic Knights have continued to push against their borders, into lands that Poles have good cause to see as Polish."}
@{"The Catholic Church remains strong in Poland, a useful unifying force for any king to use. Heretics have a habit of arising in Bohemia and nearby lands, and there are Orthodox lands to the south and east, the homes of potential enemies. The support of Mother Church can generally be relied on in any attempts to bring these souls to true salvation via the sword."}
@{"Poland's borders have changed many times, as lands have been won and then allowed to slip away. Polish kings have lost few opportunities when taking advantage of their neighbours' weaknesses, even as the Teutonic Order has advanced from the west. Behind the Teutonic Order, of course, lie the ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperor. If these can be countered successfully, a warlike and resolute Polish king can still take advantage of his smaller neighbours' weaknesses. The Russian Princes are not, as yet, equals of Poland's monarchy and a move to crush them could be successful, if costly. It is, however, foolish is to ignore the intentions of the Holy Roman Emperor. To the west, the Empire remains a notional structure rather than a royal state in many respects, and one that may be vulnerable. A wrongly timed attack will, naturally, bring down the full wrath of the Emperor."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_RUSSIAN_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Russians is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"Overall, the Russian strategic position is quite strong, as the Russians have no need to worry about wars on more than one front at a time. But in order to win, the Russians will have to be aggressive conquerors, and this may well include taking on the Golden Horde. The Russians do have an exclusive unit in their armies, the Boyars, and these cavalrymen can be a very potent force, even if they may eventually be outclassed by other factions' cavalry."}
@{"Russia is a land emerging from the empty spaces and vast forests of the steppes, and its borders are far from established. Its winters and rulers are cruel, making this a hard land of tough men. Space and distance make Russia a very different place from the kingdoms of the west, as does the Russian need to keep the steppe nomads at bay by whatever means necessary - prudent military preparations on the one hand, and bowing to the authority of the Mongol Khans on the other. As long as the Khans are given respect, Princes in Vladimir have a free hand to pursue their own ambitions."}
@{"The Orthodox Church has managed to stay distinctively Russian, making it another source of strength for the Grand Princes. This support has allowed them to move from Kiev to Vladimir as the former city has lost its trading importance. Russia is now ruled from Vladimir, but Moscow could easily be the next seat of royal government if trade patterns continue to change. But Russia is not yet a European kingdom, no matter how much its rulers may want it to be. Russia is Russia: huge, forbidding, empty, and dangerous."}
@{"Looking to the west, Poland, Lithuania and Hungary lie across the shortest routes to central Europe. Along the Baltic coast, Danish and Teutonic ambitions may have to be countered. This is true more than 80 years after Alexander Nevsky defeated the Teutonic Knights and their Scandinavian allies in battle. But Polish and German moves to the east may bring opportunities, if these kingdoms overextend their advance. To the south there is the fading imperial power of Byzantium and the growing power of the Turkish sultanate. And there are always the steppes, the endless lands to the east, although this may mean that the Tartars have to be faced."}
@{"Whatever a Russian Prince decides to do, he needs to remember the steppes and the endless hosts of steppe nomads that seem to come out of them. Russian lands are the first outposts of Orthodox Christianity in the struggle against these monstrous pagans..."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_SPANISH_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Spanish in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The Spanish position is an interesting one, with two rivals close by: the Aragonese and the Almohads, although the latter are not as powerful as they once were. Spanish military forces are much as those of other Catholic powers - their heavy specialised cavalry such as Lancers and Gendarmes are quite late developments and not exclusive to the Spanish. They do have exclusive access to the Knights of Santiago, units that only become available after a successful Crusade. The Spanish can also produce excellent Inquisitors in Castile. They also have the ability to train Spanish Jinettes."}
@{"Centuries of warfare have not yet been enough to free all of Spain from its Moorish overlords and impose Catholic order on the country. In the far south, a few die-hard Muslims remain unconquered. In the other parts of the land, there is also much work to do in rooting out the vestiges of Islamic influence - not everyone who claims to love the Church does so with the right degree of fervour, and so the Christian Kings of Spain still fight to free their lands from their blood enemies. Times of peace have been the lull before the storm. Until the remaining Muslims are driven from the Iberian peninsular, the Spanish will never feel safe. Catholic Spain has what it considers to be a divine mission to save not just the land, but also the souls of the people, and there can be no rest until the final victory is won."}
@{"Bringing Muslim lands into the Catholic fold may be worthwhile enough for some lords, but once this has been done, there are new possessions to attract the eye of any King of Spain. There is always a chance to become involved in a Mediterranean policy for acquiring new territory. Southern Italy can be vulnerable to invasion, especially if weakened by internal struggles, or if France or the Empire have invaded repeatedly from the north."}
@{"An alliance with the Holy Roman Empire can leave France surrounded and vulnerable, especially if the French are preoccupied with English entanglements. Southern France is a very different country from the north, and may accept a Spanish monarch - if the invasion can be pulled off successfully! And, finally, no King of Spain should ever forget the dynastic possibilities of marriage as a way of forming ties with almost any kingdom. As well as giving Spain claims to new lands, such links can provide allies for all kinds of adventures!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_TURKISH_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Turks is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."}
@{"At this starting date the Turks may only have one province, but their strategic position is surprisingly good. The Byzantine Empire is weaker than it has ever been before, and its former provinces are in rebellion. Expansion has never been easier, and victory will require aggressive moves into Byzantine territory, with the obvious goal of taking Constantinople. And it is at this time that the Turkish army has some of its most powerful units, such as the Janissaries and many varieties of cavalry and horse archers."} 
@{"In the last hundred years the warlike Turks have carved their way into the remaining Byzantine lands and made them their own. It would be wrong, however, to think that the Turks have been a unified force. The ruling clan, the Seljuks, has been challenged and supplanted by a new group, the Ottomans, under their dynamic leader Osman. He has attracted many to his banner and expanded Turkish lands on his own account. The Turks, no matter who rules them, continue to sit astride the most important trade routes to the Far East and thus profit from the merchants passing through their lands."}
@{"Turkish armies remain skilled and resolute in warfare, and a good deal more reliable and disciplined than many Christian troops (although the best Christian soldiers are probably a match for them). They can be justifiably proud of the martial traditions that have taken them from being steppe warriors to becoming mighty sultans. The Turks can draw on significant manpower for their armies, and should be well able to defend their possessions and push forward into disputed lands."}
@{"The Sultanate is the best placed candidate to be the destroyer of Byzantine hopes, the power that will one day bring about the final collapse of Byzantium. A wise Sultan, however, will know better than to make any such assumption, as the Byzantine Empire has weathered many crises. The Turks may be the significant power at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, but they have other enemies who would be happy to see them fail. The Islamic Mamluk military elite now rules in Egypt with plans for its own martial glory and expansion. The Turkish Sultan should keep his armies ready for defence as well as attack, and makes sure that his borders are as far to the south as possible!"}
@{"The Turks are lucky in that they can afford to plan ahead, knowing that time and accumulating wealth are their allies. The Byzantine Empire is a shadow of greatness, and beyond it are the rich pickings of Europe and the Mediterranean. It may even be possible to find Christian allies to help any advance into the Balkans. Christian princes may still profess obedience to their Church, but a certain knowing pragmatism now governs diplomacy, and this is something a powerful Sultan could use to his own benefit."}
@["FSM_faction_info_faction_DANISH_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Danes in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"In the early period the Danes have their best relative starting position. They have territory nearby in Scandinavia that can be conquered quickly and is relatively easy to defend - Denmark is the only land route to the north. The Danes also have exclusive access to Vikings and Longboats. While these will become outmoded over time, for the first years of play they are simply better than forces available to other factions. This advantage may be short-lived, but they are vital to an early, aggressive policy and give the ability to seize chances."}
@{"The lands of the north are uncompromising, and they have always produced superlative fighting men. The Vikings, the Normans, the Rus in Novgorod and Moscow and even the Varangian Guard in far-off Constantinople are all Norsemen of one sort or another. As navigators, traders and warriors, Norsemen have few rivals in the world, although their raiding voyages are now nearly at an end. Denmark is now established as the strongest of the Scandinavian kingdoms, having crushed the pagan Wends in northern Germany and their own pagans in the wilder lands to the north. The kings of Denmark have also cleverly avoided being absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire."}
@{"The Danes can do well if they can avoid being overrun by Imperial forces outside Scandinavia. They have a reasonably good chance of securing a mini-empire from Scandinavian and Baltic coastal provinces. Denmark is the only land bridge into Scandinavia, making the defence of new possessions relatively straightforward. Their position at the mouth of the Baltic makes development as a maritime power an attractive, and possibly vital, option. If the Baltic can be controlled, then Danish armies can move at will to any point along the coast. The independent duchies and principalities can be picked off and then used to expand Danish power further along the northern periphery of Europe. This policy can bring a Danish ruler into competition with Poland, Novgorod and the Holy Roman Empire, as these may be trying to acquire the same lands on the Baltic coast. Southern expansion into the rich provinces of central and western Germany is also an option for a strong Danish ruler, but one that must be carefully timed to avoid an Imperial backlash. It is a strategy that works well when Imperial authority has collapsed."}
@{"Finally, it is less than a century ago that Danish rulers could also claim the kingship of England, before the coming of the Norman overlords (descendants of Vikings themselves) who now rule there. Perhaps these old claims could be renewed, and a new maritime kingdom across the Northern seas could be created. Wherever a ship can go there could be a way for the Danish to make a profit - or a killing!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ALMOHAD_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Almohad Caliphate in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"This starting date is the hardest for the Almohads. The power of the Caliphate has waned considerably. Much of the Iberian peninsular is now lost to the increasingly strong Spanish, and to the east the Egyptians continue to grow stronger as the years pass. The Caliphate's exclusive troops such as Berber Camels are forces that are useful against weak opponents, but are now no longer as powerful relative to other units. The Almohad strength in militia and light forces now counts against it, as others factions have more advanced forces available. This is not to say the Almohad position is impossible by any means, but it is more difficult than it has ever been before. The Caliphate may look as if it could be crushed on two fronts, but the situation is not quite so straightforward. The Caliphate is a faction that still has some strengths. Its overall strategic position is good, in that it can only be attacked on narrow fronts to the north and east."} 
@{"Coming from a desert people, the Berber tribesmen of the Almohad dynasty conquered North Africa and then took Spain from its Islamic princes while supposedly helping them. Now they have lost much of Spain, but their African provinces are still fairly secure. The Almohads never enjoyed lax morality and easy living, and so have ruled their lands with a rod of iron. The Khalifah's rule has kept his subjects under control, and intolerance is now a reflection of the attitudes shown by the Kings of Spain towards their Islamic and Jewish subjects."}
@{"Catholic strength in Spain is a problem that challenges the Almohads. As a consequence, Almohad policy should be a concentration of effort against further Spanish attacks. Unless the Spanish are checked there can be no revival in Almohad fortunes, as the Iberian peninsular provinces were the richest in the Caliphate. Egypt is a tempting target, as it is potentially extremely valuable to any conqueror, but a two-front war could also bring disaster."}
@{"If the Almohads rise to meet the immediate challenges they face, then they can be a power in the Mediterranean world and beyond once more. The Aragonese and Spanish are not unbeatable - just difficult opponents - and beyond them the French and English are still at each other's throats. Simply reaching the Pyrenees would give the Khalifah's armies a natural defensive line to hold. Across the sea, the southern Italian provinces could also be rich targets, although a direct threat to Rome could unite Catholic forces. Along the north African coast, Egyptian lands may also be vulnerable as the rulers of Egypt are likely to be distracted by Turkish expansionism and the (remote) possibility of a resurgent Byzantine Empire."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ARAGONESE_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Aragonese is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."} //##changed
@{"The Kingdom of Aragon was born out of the wars fought by Christian rulers to drive the Moors out of Spain. It is one of a number of fervently Catholic kingdoms squabbling over the reconquered lands and hoping to lead Spain into a new era."}
@{"Although the Reconquista is well under way and Aragon has enjoyed some fifty years of independence, the future is far from certain. Navarre and the Castilian Spanish to the west are strong potential rivals, and the Moors still hold much of Spain beyond Aragon's southern border. Whoever wishes to dominate Spain must contend with all of these. Further west, independent Portugal may need to be reckoned with. Northward across the Pyrenees, the French were once accustomed to regarding "the Spanish Mark" - where Aragon now stands - as part of Charlemagne's Empire, and may yet lay claim to it."}
@{"Whoever controls the throne of Aragon must consider the need for Christian unity to drive out the Moors alongside the knowledge that other royal houses - the Spanish in Castile - have designs on a unified Spain. Aragon may be seen as an obstacle to that goal, not an ally or a natural leader. At various times, some of these factions have even been known to ally with the Moors against fellow Christians! Aragon's future will only be secure once all threats have been neutralized, and no organised rivals remain in Spain."}
@{"There are many options open to Aragon. Over the Pyrenees France and England are contending for control, and the provinces of Toulouse and Provence need not become attached to the French throne. To the south, the independent province of Valencia may be open to bribery: El Cid, one of the greatest generals ever to lead an army in Spain, controls the area. Navarre also offers intriguing possibilities, as its iron resources allow the creation of well-armed troops. Sooner or later, however, an Aragonese leader will have to take arms against his fellow Christians and this will cause problems with the Papacy."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_HUNGARIAN_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Hungarians in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."} //##changed
@{"Around 200 years ago, the Magyars were one of many nomadic peoples who left the steppes and rode into eastern and central Europe. Settling into the Danube basin, they became greatly feared for their raiding, which reached as far as Bremen, Orleans and Constantinople. As the kingdoms of Europe - in particular the Holy Roman Empire, which had borne the brunt of their attacks - set aside quarrels and organized their defences raiding gave way to diplomatic activity. The Magyars of Hungary became established as an ally of the Empire, guarding its flanks instead of preying upon them. The process was complete when Stephen I adopted Christianity and was recognized as King of Hungary by the Pope and Emperor in 1000. He was even proclaimed a saint after his death in 1038!"}
@{"After Stephen's death Hungary fell into a period of turmoil as rival claimants to the throne intrigued and fought for control, a time which may have lasted until the present day. After a promising beginning, Hungary is weak, and needs a strong leader who can reunite the nation and guide its fortunes into the future. The opportunities for greatness lie all around, just waiting to be grasped."}
@{"The best and quickest route to greatness probably lies in taking control of the Balkan provinces to the south and east. This will bring Hungary into competition with the Byzantine Empire, but a strong position is achievable, scotching any Byzantine plans to re-establish control over the Balkans. To the north and east there are lands to be taken on the steppes, but this can lead to frictions with the Polish. To the west, the Italians are quite powerful, and to the northwest, there is the Holy Roman Empire. The Hungarians will need to make alliances with at least one of these powers to have any chance of success, or just to postpone a day of reckoning. Finally, the Hungarians lie on the likely route of any crusading army heading towards the Holy Land. Although the crusaders will still have a long way to go, their armies can strip provinces they pass through of riches and military units who decide to 'follow the cross'."}
@{"All this said the Hungarians have a strong starting position with naturally defensible frontiers. They can do well if they choose to grasp their opportunities."}


@["FSM_faction_info_faction_SICILIAN_EARLY"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Sicilians is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."} //##changed
@{"Sicily has been in Norman hands for almost fifty years, but history warns any ruler of this turbulent island against complacency. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantines, and no less than five Muslim houses from various parts of the Mediterranean have ruled here. None have held onto their possession."}
@{"The chief virtue of Sicily lies in its position rather than in its land or inherent wealth - though a gifted ruler could manage these to great advantage. Linking the eastern and western halves of the Mediterranean, and offering a short maritime route from north Africa to Italy, control of the island is vital to any power that seeks to have a firm grip on the Mediterranean world. It is also the perfect base from which to strike out, for an attack can go in almost any direction."}
@{"Given its strategic importance, Sicily must look to its own defence first and foremost, for it cannot rely on a publicly peaceful stance to protect it. Southern Italy is a ripe target for expansion, and if a foothold can be established in North Africa, a wedge will be driven between the Islamic lands of the eastern and western Mediterranean, which might lead to the eventual weakening of Islamic power. Shipping will be vital to this enterprise, and a maritime trading empire among the islands of the Mediterranean is another worthy goal."}
@{"Going north into Naples is tempting, but war against the Byzantine Empire is a strategy that needs to be carefully considered before it is undertaken. If the Empire is busy with other wars, then it can be an easy way to expand quickly. The problem with moving further up the Italian mainland is the Papacy. It bars the way north, and any attack on the Pope and his forces will result in excommunication, a serious problem unless the Papal lands can be quickly overrun. A maritime strategy offers the chance of trade and the creation of an overseas empire on the mainland of Europe, or on the islands of the eastern Mediterranean. Pursuing both strategies is liable to be too expensive for the Sicilian treasury!"}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_ARAGONESE_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Aragonese is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."} //##changed
@{"After almost two centuries of fighting the Moors are yet to be expelled from the Iberian peninsular. Aragon has done well, expanding its influence and keeping pace with the rise of the Castilian Spanish. While it does not yet enjoy pre-eminence in the Iberian peninsular, it is a power that must be considered in this corner of Christendom."}
@{"Although the Moors still hold on in the south, the Christian powers in Spain - Aragon included - must look to the future, and decide the shape of Spain for centuries to come. The Reconquista has been hampered by intrigues among the Christian Kingdoms, intrigues that have even led them to ally with the Islamic Almohad Caliphate to gain momentary advantage! It is obvious that once the Moors are gone, there will be a settling of old scores, and the battle for control of Christian, Catholic Spain will begin in earnest."}
@{"Aragon's position facing eastwards is a major advantage over its rivals, giving access to the Mediterranean and Italy. Leon, Castile and Portugal have Atlantic coasts, which means a long journey through the Straits of Gibraltar to gain access to the Mediterranean and its rich trading potential. The English and French lie to the north, hemming in opportunities in that direction. The Aragonese must take land where they can, but must at all costs retain access to the sea and the lands beyond. There is much lucrative trade to be had, and possibly some overseas provinces."}

@["FSM_faction_info_faction_HUNGARIAN_HIGH"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Hungarians in this period is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."} //##changed
@{"Hungary has suffered from dynastic warfare for more than 150 years. Rival claimants to the throne have called in allies from Hungary's more powerful neighbours, and have paid for their help in land. Despite this, the kingdom has acquired Croatia and other neighbouring territories. Internal politics and intrigues within the Holy Roman Empire have also helped, and somehow Hungary has contrived to live at peace with its neighbours during its period of internal strife."}
@{"However, this good fortune cannot last forever. Hungary is in desperate need of a strong leader who will restore peace and stability to the country. Once this is done, the comparative weakness of Hungary's neighbours offers the potential for expansion, especially in lands ceded to foreign supporters of the various rival claimants to the throne. Under the guidance of a strong and able king, Hungary could well become the leading power in central Europe, eclipsing both the Holy Roman Empire and the remains of the Byzantine Empire."}
@{"At this point in time, the best route to greatness lies in taking control of the Balkan provinces to the south and east. While this will make Hungary a direct rival to the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantines will have problems of their own - the recapture of Constantinople from the "Latin" Emperors. There may even be a chance for the Hungarians to press on towards Constantinople and take it for their own! In doing so, however, the Hungarians must be careful not to leave open a back door for an invasion by the Holy Roman Empire. To the north and east there are also lands to be taken on the steppes. Finally, the Hungarians still lie on the likely route of any crusading army heading towards the Holy Land. Although the crusaders will still have a long way to go, their armies can devastate provinces as they march through, stripping riches and troops."}
@{"All this said the Hungarians have a strong starting position with naturally defensible frontiers. They can do well if they choose to grasp their opportunities."}

@{"It is ten years since the Hohenstaufen dynasty took control of Sicily from the Norman de Hauteville family, but despite this change the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies now extends across much of southern Italy, and its landholdings easily exceed those of the Papal States."}
@{"Sicily's main virtue is its position at the crossroads of the Mediterranean. It links North Africa to Italy just as it links the eastern and western Mediterranean. Any kingdom that wishes to control a Mediterranean empire must, sooner or later, deal with Sicily. So if they wish to survive, the Sicilians must be prepared to defend their lands."}
@{"On the other hand, if it is to expand, Sicily needs good-quality land and income. The farmlands of northern Italy are a tempting target, but well defended. The islands of the Mediterranean are vulnerable, and maritime power will be the decisive factor in creating and holding together such a realm. Whoever rules the seas of the Mediterranean is halfway to ruling the lands along the coast, and Sicily is well placed to do just that. Perhaps the unification of Italy for the first time since the Romans is also a goal that could be achieved."}
@{"Any Sicilian plans for expansion must take into account the political power of the Pope. An attack on the Papal States is one obvious strategy for the Sicilians, but one that results in almost-instant excommunication. Such an assault needs to be fast, merciless and, above all, successful as excommunicated Catholics are fair game for the Crusades which the Pope will waste no time in demanding! There are other directions for Sicilian expansionism: east to take more Mediterranean islands while the Byzantines are preoccupied with the recovery of Constantinople; further north bypassing the Pope to occupy vulnerable northern Italian provinces; or south against the Muslims. This last may prove successful if the Almohads and Spanish are at war."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Very Hard. Playing the Aragonese is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."} //##changed
@{"The last century has been good for Aragon. The Castilian Spanish may have the greater share of land on the Iberian peninsular, but the Moors have been driven to the south, now hanging on to their last lands in Europe in Granada, and the independent realms of Navarre and Portugal are not an immediate threat to the Aragonese. The struggle for eventual mastery of what should be Catholic Spain is, however, an inevitable one: the Castilian Spanish will wish to be the rulers of a Spanish empire, an ambition that Aragonese kings should also have. Only when the Castilians have been neutralized will Aragon's western land borders be safe."}
@{"Overseas, however, Aragonese power has grown almost unchecked. The revolt of the "Sicilian Vespers" some 40 years ago eventually resulted in the Sicilians choosing the King of Aragon as a new master. There are other claims to Sicily, but these have so far come to nothing. Local customs and liberties have been carefully maintained, and Sicily is a powerful base for further Aragonese expansion into southern Italy or the rest of the Mediterranean. This could bring conflict with the Italians over trade routes, but it holds out the possibility of enormous wealth. It also makes Aragon strategically tenacious - it is difficult for an enemy to wipe out the Aragonese quickly simply because their provinces are widely separated. It is also a potential vulnerability, as nothing good comes without a price: an enemy fleet can blockade Aragonese reinforcements by sea. Careful planning when beginning a campaign is important for any Aragonese success."}
@{"On the Iberian peninsular the only real opposition comes from the Spanish, centred in Castile. The Almohad Moors are unlikely to be a threat, but may be a potential ally against the Spanish. To the north, the French are still engaged in their long struggle with the English, and a clever Aragonese monarch may be able to take advantage of this, snatching a province or two (possibly by instigating revolts) while the English and French bicker. In Italy, the Papacy stands directly astride the way to the north, and a confrontation with the Pope can have unfortunate consequences. Excommunication by the Pope can be a terrible punishment, especially when Aragon shares borders with the fanatically Catholic Spanish. Further to the east, the Byzantine Empire is still hanging on and it is possible that its current weakness is the final decline before extinction. With a strong navy and a Sicilian base it is possible for the Aragonese to benefit from this situation."}
@{"Overall, then, the Aragonese must take land where they can, but must at all costs retain access to the sea and the lands this opens up for conquest and trade."}


@["FSM_faction_info_faction_HUNGARIAN_LATE"]
@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Fairly Easy. Playing the Hungarians in this period is slightly easier for any given difficulty setting than most other factions in the game."} //##changed
@{"Some 80 years have passed since the Mongol Tatars overran Hungary in 1241. Although they withdrew the following spring, thanks to the death of their Great Khan in far-off Karakorum, Hungary was devastated. Around half the population was killed in battle, in massacres or from starvation; the cities and towns themselves were reduced to ashes. Added to this, several of Hungary's neighbours took advantage of their misfortune to seize some of its lands. Although King Bela IV started to rebuild the shattered nation, his death in 1270 threw Hungary into dynastic chaos once again. The line of St. Stephen, the founder of Hungary, is now extinct, and in 1310 Charles Robert, a French noble with blood ties through his mother to the throne of Hungary, was crowned king."}
@{"Foreign or native, the kings of Hungary have a daunting task ahead. The devastation of the Tatars has been compounded by decades of internal strife, and by no means all the ruling nobles are loyal. A strong hand must rule the country if its former glory is to be regained. Probably the best route to greatness lies in seizing control of the provinces to the south and east. There are rich provinces to be taken, if it is done quickly and decisively. Constantinople is also an obvious target, but one that is as hard to take as it is valuable. The Byzantine Empire may be in a long decline but this should not be confused with dying (just yet), and is still wealthy enough to defend itself. To the north and west the Holy Roman Empire is strong, and an attack in that direction is probably only practical when the Empire is occupied elsewhere. The Italians may be vulnerable to a quick attack if they leave Venice weakly defended, but any war against them is likely to be protracted. To the north the Poles are a potential rival - or a potential quick killing. An eastern European empire based on Hungary and Poland could be quite a powerful force."}
@{"So, although the Hungarians are surrounded by potentially hostile powers, this also gives them the chance to strike out in a variety of directions in their search for a historic destiny!"}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Hard. Playing the Irish is equivalent to a harder difficulty setting than the basic one you chose."} //##changed
@{"Protected by the sea that divides it from the largest of the British Isles, Ireland was never a Roman province. The importation of Christianity has had a profound effect on its native Celtic culture, but by and large, Ireland has kept to itself, relying on the sea as a defence, and mounting only occasional sea-raids against Wales and the west of England. The migration of the Dal Riada and the resulting creation of Scotland was an isolated event, and so far no other Irish people has followed their example."}
@{"However, the English already cast covetous eyes on Wales and Scotland, and it can only be a matter of time before they try to add Ireland to their realms. Graver still is the threat of the Vikings, to whom the sea is the "whale-road" rather than a barrier. The Irish can no longer count on living in peace, but must prepare to fight long and hard against foreign enemies - if not for the conquest of other lands, then in the defence of their own. A strategy of making Ireland an expensive and bloody place to invade can be a worthwhile first step towards eventual domination, using the warriors created for defence to carry the attack overseas."}
@{"A strong king leading a united Ireland has a number of options, all of which rely on some sea power. If Wales can be taken while the Welsh, Saxons and the rest are distracted, Ireland can establish itself as a power on the British mainland. The Scots have also shown one invasion route from Ireland: into the western lowlands. If they can do it, perhaps the Irish can follow. The Vikings will have to take the Scottish Isles and part of the north to make a permanent and complete conquest of Ireland feasible, but if Ireland takes these provinces first (or looks to its own defences if this proves impossible), the Vikings' plans can be stalled - and perhaps a unified Celtic empire can be established."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Easy. Playing the Mercians is the equivalent of an easier difficulty setting than the basic one you chose for the campaign."} //##changed
@{"Mercia is the westernmost of the kingdoms of the Angles, and the greatest rival to the Saxon kingdoms of the south. While it lacks the wealth of Saxon lands, it is still a force to be reckoned with, but its position is a dangerous one. With Northumbria to the north and the Saxon kingdoms to the south, Mercia risks being absorbed if, as seems likely, the trend toward unification continues, especially if the Saxons use their wealth and power well. Further problems may come from the Welsh and Irish to the west and the expanding threat of the Vikings to the east. If Northumbria falls to the Vikings, Mercia will be faced with powerful rivals on all sides."}
@{"Surrounded on all sides, Mercia may seem to have an unenviable position. Threats can come from almost any direction. The Mercian strength is that they can take advantage of any neighbour's weakness in any direction too. They are unlikely to suffer in the first wave of Viking attacks, while their rivals are likely to be weakened, if not entirely defeated."}
@{"The Kingdom of Mercia must expand aggressively if it hopes to keep pace with the expansion of the Saxon kingdoms, or it will risk becoming a second-class nation and a minor power in England - or worse still, a province of the Saxons or some other people. Attacking the Saxons is a dangerous game unless the Vikings have already weakened them but, sooner or later, Mercia and the Saxons must confront each other for the leadership of England. Taking Northumbria will prevent it from falling to the Vikings, but Mercia must then be prepared to face the Vikings. And this is no easy task, needing all the strength that can be mustered."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Fairly Hard. Playing the Northumbrians is a little harder than the difficulty level set for the campaign."} //##changed
@{"Northumbria is a centre of religion, learning and culture. For many years, Northumbria's safety was assured by its peaceful nature and by the respect of other Christian peoples for its culture and learning. Unfortunately, the only thing that impresses the pagan Vikings is the gold and silver that are stored in Northumbrian churches and monasteries. The kingdom is home to the great monasteries of Lindisfarne and Monkwearmouth, the home of the Venerable Bede, a scholar renowned throughout western Christendom. Other Northumbrian priests are equally learned and Alcuin of York, for example, has journeyed to the Frankish court to help the cause of education in that place. None of this learning impresses the Vikings one bit."}
@{"The Vikings are not the only potential threat that faces the kingdom. To the north, the Picts and Scots have been keeping each other busy, but it can only be a matter of time before they look southward. To the south, Mercia is squeezed between Northumbria and the Saxon kingdoms. If it wants to expand, it can only go north or south. Northumbria must marshal its resources and prepare to defend itself - if it hopes to survive as a Christian kingdom."}
@{"Northumbria's position is not hopeless. Its frontiers are defensible, but need constant attention. Strong defences will also encourage the Vikings to look elsewhere for their spoils. Expansion to the north may be tempting but is likely to cost more than it is worth, as the lands there are harsh and relatively poor, although it will be necessary to defeat the Picts and Scots in the long term. The lands to the south are more tempting thanks to their inherent relative wealth, and an attack in that direction can forestall any Mercian aggression before it has chance to begin."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the Picts is no harder or easier than the difficulty level set for the campaign."} //##changed
@{"The original inhabitants of the lands the Romans called Caledonia, the Picts stand apart from their Celtic and Germanic neighbours. For almost four centuries they thwarted the northward expansion of Roman Britain, mounting devastating raids that put Hadrian's Wall out of commission more than once. Since the coming of the Scots to the western parts of their lands, they have fought continually to resist Scottish expansion and win back their land."}
@{"With the appearance of the Vikings on the scene, the Picts are caught in a vice. With Scots to the west and Vikings to the east, they will have to fight for their very survival. The leader who can fend off these two threats and create a strong, independent Pictland will have to be both a great warrior and a gifted administrator, for their lands are undeveloped and lack the rich resources of other nations. But they are a tenacious people, fighting off first the Celts then the Romans, so who is to say that they cannot maintain their independence in the face of these new threats, and perhaps even extend their influence beyond their ancestral lands?"}
@{"The Picts have many problems, but can also profit from the problems of others. Their lands may not be quite tempting enough to bring down the fury of the Vikings. This can mean that they are left in peace for a time while raids and invasions from the sea weaken others. And a weakened rival is a vulnerable rival. A patient, but not too patient, Pictish ruler can wait for the Vikings to do much of his dirty work, before descending on enemies who are now too weak to fight back against a Pictish invasion on top of their other problems. Of course, there are no guarantees that the Vikings will do their part in this grand scheme!"}

@{"Since arriving in Britain two centuries ago, the Saxons have laid claim to the majority of southern England, including the richest farming land in Britain. Their warlike nature tempered by their conversion to Christianity, and by their agricultural ease, the Saxon kings have become the leaders of a wealthy and stable kingdom. Various kings have tried to spread their influence over the rest of England, but so far, no ruler's achievements have survived his death. It can only be a matter of time, though, before the powerful English kingdoms confront each other, just as they have each absorbed numerous smaller kingdoms to reach their present size."}
@{"The quality and extent of the Saxon lands cannot fail to attract covetous enemies, both from the Saxons' English neighbours and those from further afield. Sporadic wars with Wales and Mercia are routine, but have yet to amount to anything serious. However, the new threat from the Vikings is something more serious. If the Saxons - and the other English kingdoms - are not to be conquered piecemeal by these bloodthirsty pagans, a strong leader will be needed to hold the Saxon people together, and ultimately to lead the defence of England itself. A king who can accomplish this will be remembered in the sagas as truly great."}
@{"The Saxons have a tremendous advantage in controlling the richest areas of the British Isles. This also makes their lands a tremendously tempting target for others, of course, especially the Vikings. A Saxon ruler needs to look to defence, and sometimes this may mean that attacking opportunities have to be allowed to slip away. With luck, the chance to attack will come again, but if the Saxon heartlands are lost the Saxons will be a defeated people. That said, the Saxons are blessed with good warriors; their housecarles are the equal of most Viking warriors in a fair fight, but with a good Saxon general in command, who says any fight has to be fair?"}

@{"The far north of Britain was never conquered by the Romans, and in the wake of Roman collapse, the entire people of the Dal Riada migrated north-eastward across the sea and settled in the lands formerly held by the Caledonians. The Scots - as they now call themselves - have a strong Celtic culture, only mellowed a little by their conversion to Christianity. The Scots have pushed the Picts eastward as they expanded the boundaries of Scotland, but it will take a strong leader to bring the two peoples into a united nation."}
@{"The Scots are in a good defensive position, although the sea is not as much of a protection as it might appear - especially where the Vikings are concerned. There is also the danger that other tribes from Ireland might set sail for Scotland, and attack their western lands: on a rare, clear day it is possible to see the south-west Scotland from the north-eastern coast of Ireland. The Picts can also be tenacious enemies, fighting to defend their homeland. For now, the English kingdoms to the south are too busy fighting among themselves to be much of a threat, although that could change if a strong king manages to bring order."}
@{"Expansion has to be a high priority for the Scots. Their lands are not rich, and there are tempting targets to be taken, but this needs to be done carefully. It is probably foolish for the Scots to fight more than one foe at a time, as they may not have the manpower to spare for two parallel wars. Better by far to crush nearby rivals one at a time then make the move for greater power and territory! The Scots, however, do have an advantage in that their soldiers - especially the Highlanders - can be fearsome warriors indeed."}

@{"'From the fury of the Northmen, O lord, deliver us!' Prayers did not deliver the Northumbrian island monastery of Lindisfarne from the first recorded Viking raid in 793 AD. In the years that followed, the Vikings' raiding intensified, and then gave way to conquest. Within a century they had established permanent bases in England, Ireland and Scotland. The "Danelaw" - occupying most of northern and eastern England - became a Viking kingdom, and the Vikings came close to overrunning the whole country."}
@{"The last couple of centuries have seen the Anglo-Saxons become soft, and their lands are ripe for the taking, just as they took them from the Roman Britons. Unless some power manages to unify the English into a single strong kingdom, they can be conquered piecemeal. So, the time is now right for conquest - nothing can compete with the Viking ships at sea, and few can match Viking ferocity on the battlefield! The Viking homelands are secure, but inhospitable, and there are richer lands to be conquered. The future lies in forceful expansion!"}
@{"There are many possibilities for this expansion, either in vigorously attacking one of the kingdoms on the mainland from the start, or adopting a peripheral strategy of making islands into bases for further conquest. The Northumbrians are particularly tempting, given that they are the closest target, but the Vikings can do equally well by taking the islands of the Orcades, Dormon and Manau to act as staging posts for a second wave of raids and attacks on the British and Irish main islands. In either case, Viking strength lies in the ability to attack from the sea at almost any point - no battle need ever be fought against overwhelming odds when weaker defences can be found! However, a Viking leader will also have to change from simply attacking weak foes to a strategy of conquest. New lands must be taken and held if there is to be any chance of a Viking victory. And the Vikings also have the men for this task: their Berserkers and Huscarles are among the best warriors in the world - and it should be remembered that they make up the famous Varangian Guard in far-off Byzantium!"}

@{"In the fifth and sixth centuries Anglo-Saxon settlers from the mainland of Europe overran almost all of the Roman province of Britain. The original Celtic inhabitants of Britain were forced out of the fertile south and east into the more rugged and easily defended lands that were eventually to become Wales and Scotland. While the Celts of Wales kept their language and many other aspects of their pre-Roman culture, they were now staunchly Christian, and played a major role in the spreading of Christianity to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England."}
@{"At the same time, tensions between the Welsh and their new English neighbours are low. The English have been kept busy fighting among themselves to unify England, and the Welsh have been content to keep the lands they have. Apart from sporadic cross-border raiding - which hardly counts as war to the Celtic mind - and the presence across the region of priests and monks, the two peoples hardly interact."}
@{"It will take a strong leader to defend Wales against outsiders, and an even stronger one to unite and lead the independent-minded Welsh! There are dangers and opportunities in the Welsh position: they are in a strong defensive position, but it can only be a matter of time before the English or the Vikings begin to cast covetous eyes on their lands and resources. The isolated areas of Cerniu and Defnas (modern Cornwall and Devon) are likely to be difficult to reinforce. However, Welsh borders are rugged and relatively easy to defend for the most part. Attacking out to the east into the flatter English midlands is not quite hard, but given the fact Wales has no protected heartland, a Welsh leader needs to bear in mind that invasion can leave his base vulnerable to invasion from land or sea. The Viking threat is quite real, even though Wales is a long voyage away from the Norse homelands in Scandinavia."}

@{"Faction Difficulty Rating: Moderate. Playing the (German) Holy Roman Empire in this period is no harder or easier than the overall difficulty level set for the campaign."}
@{"The Holy Roman Empire at this early start date presents problems and opportunities. The size of the Empire itself is something of a problem, as it is not quite large enough to completely dominate the continent. There are potential enemies on all sides too. The Empire has to both hang on to what it already has and pursue a process of aggressive conquest against each of its enemies in turn. The Empire's (almost) exclusive troops appear relatively late in the game, but they are worth the wait. Gothic Knights, particularly from Saxony, are among the most powerful armoured cavalry available to any faction, and Gothic sergeants are equally good for their class. Crusades too can be a powerful weapon for the Empire."}
@{"Although apparently surrounded by rivals and subject to internal dissent, the Holy Roman Empire is not the weakling power it might seem. The Emperor is the overlord - for the most part - of vast tracts of Germany and beyond, but his need to keep dissent and disloyalty under control can be a limitation on his power. Few within the Empire feel loyalty to anything beyond their immediate locality, making effective Imperial government almost the same as Imperial military occupation. Added to this is a rivalry with the Pope over who holds the ultimate authority within the Empire: Emperors have created their own Popes and then been excommunicated by the same men!"}
@{"If, however, the Emperor succeeds in keeping his provinces in line, his powers for further conquest are formidable indeed. Any new lands he takes only add to his power and can, with careful management, eventually be more loyal to the idea of 'the Empire' than the older Imperial provinces inside Germany."}
@{"A drive to the east against Poland can give easy pickings providing care is taken. The Poles can have problems of their own on their eastern frontiers, and judicious pressure from Germany can yield real gains. A move to the southeast is possible, into the Balkans and towards the Black Sea, brushing aside or absorbing the petty kingdoms there. To the south, the rich provinces of the Italian peninsular are a temptation with an additional bonus in controlling Rome and thus influencing the Papacy, although this has the risk of causing religious unrest. To the west, the French are often distracted by their wars with England. The Empire, however, needs to avoid war against more than one opponent at a time. A central position may allow the Emperor to strike out in any direction, but he can also be attacked anywhere along his borders."}
@{"Finally, no Emperor should overlook the possibilities for power presented by a Crusade when the Pope calls for one. Who is to say what lands might be available in the wake of such an endeavour?"}
