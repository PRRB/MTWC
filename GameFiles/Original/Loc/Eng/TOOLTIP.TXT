// Notes to translators.
//
// i) Only those things between 
// {" "} need to be translated.
// and the 
// {" "} should be left in.
// (Unless otherwise specified.)
//
//
// ii) If an untranslated string will have 
// (!ENG!) (!FRA!) (!DEU!) 
// (!ITA!) (!ESP!) (!JAP!) 
// (!SCH!) (!TCH!) (!KOR!)
// at the end of the string.
// This is so we can detect untranslated stings
// easily and can see that they have not been 
// translated when the program has been run.
// Once the translation has been done acceptably
// they should be removed.



// iii) The data is organized as follows 
// 
// ["this is a label"]
// {"This is the translation"}
//
// ["This is another label"]		 
// {"This is another translation"}
// etc


//
// Comments are ignored and will be stripped out later
// They can be used to issue instructions or for information.
//

//???? Remove when localized.

["loyalty_tooltip"]
{"Indication of how loyal this general is. "}

@["loyalty_rating"]
@{"This man's plotting of your downfall is no doubt about to come to fruition. It would be best to remove him...permanently."}
@{"This man is likely to be the cause of many of your problems both at home and abroad. Remove him and you will probably solve many of your rebellion difficulties."}
@{"This man is either considering attempting a coup or well on the road to organising one. It is better to be safe than sorry and put him somewhere where he is unable to do so."}
@{"This man's loyalty is in serious question. Placing him in charge of a large army may not be wise, in case you end up having to fight that army in the not too distant future."}
@{"This man's faith in your leadership may be wavering. You should either take steps to improve his loyalty or keep him close to you."}
@{"This man's loyalty to the country is what one would expect of a commander of your forces."}
@{"This commander has sworn fealty to you and will keep his word of honour - of that you can have no doubt."}
@{"This man's strong faith in your leadership abilities makes him most loyal to you. He should be considered worthy to lead a sizeable army."}
@{"Should troubles threaten to erupt into a civil war, you can count on this man to be standing by your side."}
@{"This man's staunch faith in you makes him a valuable man to have under your command. For him, no action is considered too base when defending your person or rule."}

@["influence_rating"]
@{"You are virtually ignored outside your own borders. Foreign parties consider you of little or no consequence."}
@{"You command little influence in matters abroad. Other factions are highly unlikely to take heed of what you have to say."}
@{"While you have a voice in the world, it is small and seldom heard. Steps must be taken to make other countries sit up and take notice."}
@{"Your actions away from home, while having some influence, do not always reach the right ears. Increase your empire and be more decisive on the field of battle to capture the attention of other monarchs."}
@{"You are recognised as a significant power in the world, but some countries still find it acceptable to politely ignore your suggestions. Perhaps a more forceful foreign policy is required."}
@{"The realm you rule is regarded with respect and not a little envy. Small factions may follow your lead, but it will take a little more effort to make the major powers bend to your will."}
@{"A proposal of alliance from you will be most seriously considered by all players in the world of politics. Choose your allies carefully - a fall from grace can be as equally spectacular as a rise."}
@{"Foreign powers will fight amongst themselves to be favoured with an alliance with you. Used wisely, this state of affairs can guarantee your lineage for generations to come."}
@{"You are amongst the select few in the world who can truly be said to have a major influence over your fellow man. You should be safe in the knowledge that whatever you do you, someone will support your decisions."}
@{"You have the ear of many of the foreign powers in the world and the attention of all of them. Leaders who oppose you risk much indeed."}
@{"No sane man would dare stand against you in matters of state. Treaties are likely to be accepted without a second thought and seldom broken by the other party, no matter what transgressions you may perform."}


@["other_influence_rating"]
@{"It is a wonder this man is considered a leader of his people at all, for the amount of influence he commands. Not a man to be considered a serious political threat."}
@{"His opinions are of no matter in the world of international politics. He is not likely to affect actions of other parties as either an ally or an enemy."}
@{"His opinions are of little consequence in the wider scheme of things, although he has been known to sway a vote in the past."}
@{"One of the minor powers in the world. He is not a threat on his own, although small powers in large numbers have been known to cause problems for more influential parties."}
@{"An influential man, but one need not take his word as law. He has some influence over the smaller factions, but others do not feel the need to consider his position when discussing foreign policy."}
@{"A man who controls a nation which is fast becoming powerful in the political arena. Still not large enough to be considered a major power, but perhaps caution should be advised before dismissing him out of hand."}
@{"One of the more desirable alliance prospects. Official ties with this man should be considered should the opportunity arise, but be wary of repercussions from this man's rivals."}
@{"An alliance with this faction would certainly strengthen your position. Any effort required in making an alliance with this man would not be poorly spent."}
@{"There are few men indeed who hold such influence in the decisions of neighbouring countries. It would be fortuitous to count this man as an ally - the alternative is not such a welcoming prospect."}
@{"This man is one of the major players in the game of international politics. His words should be carefully considered before actions are taken. Some say this man has grown too powerful and should be watched with caution."}
@{"This man has achieved the pinnacle of international power. Such influence should not be wielded by one man and steps should be taken to strip him of it before he grinds enemies and allies alike into the dust in his goal of total conquest."}


["piety_tooltip"]

@["piety_rating"]
@{"The fact that this man feels no compunction to safeguard his immortal soul is disconcerting. Perhaps he has none - an even greater cause for worry..."}
@{"Perhaps he has noticed the places of worship that true believers pray in. If he is aware of their existence, he is certainly not aware of their correct purpose."}
@{"He is only dimly aware of the omnipotent forces that guide our daily lives. Ignorance will not save this man from his fate when the Day of Judgement is at hand."}
@{"His continued ignorance of the divine means that the devout will, in turn, ignore him in his hour of need."}
@{"A familiarity with prayer may be enough to participate in worship, but only a true follower will secure the support of the religious masses."}
@{"This man can be considered a true believer, although his faith has not dominated his life. A few like-minded individuals may support him should he request it."}
@{"A faithful man that is more devout than most, this individual can expect to garner support from the religious communities whose religious views match his own."}
@{"Religion plays a significant part in this man's life. Should the need arise, his belief will secure some support from the population's faithful."}
@{"Seen as a major participator in religious activities, this man's popularity amongst those of his faith will ensure sizeable support should he call for it."}
@{"God-fearing but persuasive, this man can whip up the faithful masses into a frenzy. Should he call for support, a sizeable force would muster to meet his request."}
@{"One of the most active public figures in his religious community, this man's fervour will rouse all but the most apathetic amongst the followers of his faith."}


["dread_tooltip"]
{"The degree to which this man instills fear in others. "}

@["dread_rating"]
@{"This man is considered approachable by all, generally as either the instigator or the butt of some joke or other."}
@{"A jovial character who is easy to get to know although there is, perhaps, a hardness about him that warns that he will only be pushed so far."}
@{"Open and friendly most of the time but given to bouts of moody introspection. There is a glimmer of something dark in this man's personality, although he hides it extremely well."}
@{"In general, a pleasant person, although he has been known to have one or two explosive outbursts. His bark is considered to be much worse than his bite."}
@{"On first glance, he exudes charm and easy smiles, but there are stories told that this man's past hides darker deeds. However, there is no evidence to back up this suspicion."}
@{"His steely gaze and tendency to stay silent have been enough to unnerve many a steadfast man. Not especially malevolent but there is something about this man that strikes a chord. Caution is advised."}
@{"Tales of brutality towards prisoners have tainted this man's record. The rumours are wild, but reported incidents cannot be completely dismissed as mere stories."}
@{"This man has had the blood of innocents on his hands on more than one occasion. His public face is that of man who is prepared to go further than most to attain his goals. Such men are useful, but also dangerous."}
@{"Stories of his butchering of women and children may be unfounded, but he has certainly waded across lakes of blood to achieve his objectives. "}
@{"People fall silent when he enters a room. He seems to walk shrouded in permanent shadow. Tales of his deeds, both mighty and vile, are told in whispers."}
@{"A tempestuous man whose brutality is matched only by his remorselessness. None are safe from him - adult, child, prince or pauper - all will bend to his will or suffer the consequences. "}


["generalship_tooltip"]
{"How able this man is to command a fighting force. "}

@["generalship_rating"]
@{"As a general, he has yet to show any merit on the field of battle."}

@{"It is obvious to see that a devious military mind is emerging. We are witnessing the development of a superb commander."}
@{"The enemy know fear when they see his banner flying on the field of combat. A sound military thinker and superb tactician."}
@{"A man well respected and admired throughout the world as an excellent battlefield commander. No doubt he will continue to shine as his career continues."}
@{"This man's uncanny ability on the field of battle has ensured victory after victory. Knowing who to preserve and who to sacrifice can make any battle turn to one's favour."}
@{"One of the true greats when it comes to military command. This man has the knack of taking raw recruits and turning them into a fearsome war machine."}
@{"Battles orchestrated by his hand almost seem to be accompanied by music. If there is an art to war, then this man is a master of his craft."}
@{"A legend in his own lifetime on the battlefield, his grasp of military tactics is unsurpassed."}


["acumen_tooltip"]
{"How adept this man is at running an economy. "}

@["acumen_rating"]
@{"This man's education is on par with the common man, but no leader would entrust the running of a province to a peasant."}
@{"Literacy and numeracy are essential qualities in any official post, so it is probably best to keep this man out of office."}
@{"A rudimentary grasp of reading and writing means this man is better qualified than most to hold office."}
@{"A somewhat slow learner, but he possesses a dogged determination that sees tasks through to the end. An adequate candidate for an official."}
@{"His proficiency at economics and people management will ensure that the economy would not suffer, but it is unlikely to prosper either."}
@{"A good mediator and one who has a working knowledge in all aspects of finance. One to consider for any role where financial stability is required."}
@{"A knowledgeable man whose occasional flashes of inspiration have made him something of an authority on monetary matters."}
@{"Sound business thinking in the past has allowed this man to prosper more than most. If left to his own devices, he would probably be quite an affluent merchant by now."}
@{"One who seldom makes mistakes in matters of finance. Economies can only prosper under his governorship."}
@{"A calculating personality and excellent educational background has honed this man into a person destined to hold office."}
@{"A master economist who's grasp of trading, book-keeping and markets has made him one of the foremost experts in the world. Economies will flourish under his guidance."}
