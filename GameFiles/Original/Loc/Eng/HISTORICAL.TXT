["Milan_Description"]				{"Frederick Barbarossa's campaign in Italy was to re-establish the authority of the Holy Roman Empire, and even re-establish the very concept of the Empire. The Italians, having been independent for so long, were reluctant to yield to any external authority, especially one that wasn't even Italian! Barbarossa's campaign strategy in Italy was therefore everything that could be expected from a medieval warlord. It was thorough, brutal and effective. Barbarossa correctly guessed that the inhabitants of Milan would be more amenable to his demands if they were starving when he besieged them, so he made sure that this would be the case by cutting their supplies."}

According to some accounts of the battle Barbarossa was forced to withdraw behind the walls of Baradello when his forces were attacked in the flank by cavalry from Milan. The castle of Carcano was subsequently destroyed by the victors. You must do better than Barbarossa and win the battle."}
["Carcano_Conditions"]			 	{"Don't lose your king, he is the driving force behind your campaign. If you lose more than 60% of your troops, you will soon run out of knights to fight for your cause. Frederick Barbarossa needed his knights to subdue Northern Italy."}

["Legnano_Description"]				{"Over a period of 16 years Frederick Barbarossa continued to campaign in Italy. At Legnano he ran into an army that was ready and waiting and, on the day, better organised and led. Historically, Barbarossa's army was defeated at Legnano by a combined force including troops from Lombardy, Milan and the Papal armies. His enemies even managed to kill his standard bearer and force Barbarossa to escape after abandoning his horse. He was forced to abandon his dreams of Imperial glory and make his peace with Pope Alexander III, finally being forgiven and accepted back into the Church in 1177. You have a chance to reverse this disastrous result for the Holy Roman Emperor."}

["SanRomano_Description"]		 	{"Under siege by the Imperial Army lead by Frederick Barbarossa, the citizens of Milan became desperate enough to try any stratagem that would break the siege. With help unlikely to reach them from beyond the besieging army, their best option was to sally forth and attack. If they could reach the Imperial baggage train it could be destroyed and the besiegers would have to lift the siege. If they could destroy some of Barbarossa's siege engines and artillery this too would benefit them. A wise commander, such as Barbarossa, could still be caught off balance by such a sally, but would soon organise a temporary defence to counter it."}

["MilanFort_Description"]		 	{"This engagement is typical of many that had to be fought during Frederick Barbarossa's advance into northern Italy. The cities of Italy were rich by European standards and could afford better defences than only their city walls. They could also finance the construction of outlying forts and fortified villages that would either delay an attacker with yet another siege, or allow the defenders to sally forth and harrass an attacker's supply lines. To forestall such attacks, a prudent commander - and Barbarossa was a good general - would make sure the outlying defences were destroyed before moving on to his main objective. In this case, the small town has to be taken and held."}

Following a siege at Harfleur, Henry V lead his small, tired army on a march towards Calais and safety. He was trapped by a larger French army - some say five times as many men - and most of the English expected to die. In the event, the French nobility were their own worst enemies. They charged forward in search of glory and easy victory and met only death as they were shot down by English longbowmen. With Agincourt, Henry V began a campaign that almost put him on the French throne, but his triumphs were squandered by his successors."}

The French had been careful to avoid battle with the tactically superior English, but at Crécy they had the advantage of numbers and, apparently, better morale too. Edward chose a defensive position for his army and waited for the French attack. After exchanges between the English longbowmen and the French crossbows, the French knights lost patience and charged forwards - they even managed to trample their own crossbowmen! With little discipline, the French were cut down in droves and French knighthood lost its bravest and best."}

In 1356 an army under King Jean Le Bon of France caught up with an English raiding force near Bordeaux. Once again, the English proved themselves to be masters of selecting ground for a fight that suited them, not the French. The English longbows wreaked terrible damage, and the French 'battles' (or divisions) did not attack together. Surprised by an English counter attack, the French broke and fled, but their King was captured. Legend has it that after the battle the chivalrous Edward served dinner to his chief captive, King Jean, before sending him back to the Tower of London to await ransom."}

The French pursued closely but carefully, determined that this time an English army would not get the chance to choose defensive ground of their own liking and that their own forces would not enter the fight in a piecemeal fashion to be shot down by longbowmen.

["Arsuf_Description"]				{"The Frankish kingdoms in the Holy Land had met with mixed fortunes before the arrival of reinforcements in the shape of the Third Crusade. Before Richard Coeur de Lion and Philip II Augustus of France arrived, the Crusaders had been too weak to be much of a threat to Saladin, but with help from these European monarchs, they managed to break into Acre and take it from the Saracens. In September 1191, after a year of frustation and unhappiness with their further progress, the Crusaders moved south from Acre, making for the town of Jaffa. Outside the small settlement of Arsuf, they met a Saracen army in the open. Richard's tactical sense proved to be the decisive factor, and his victory at Arsuf restored the morale of the Third Crusade, as it proved that the Saracens were not invincible even with the example of Saladin to inspire them."}

After their victory at Arsuf in September 1191, the Crusaders took the city, but got no closer to their final goal of capturing Jerusalem. Richard's army encamped outside the city because of the stench of the dead within the walls, for in medieval times it was well-known that foul smells caused disease. In this battle, a large Saracen force has appeared, cutting off any chance of retreat and with the walls at their backs, Richard's army has no easy avenue of retreat. The Crusader position is, however, far from hopeless. Defeating Saladin's army just requires nerve and a little daring. The trick is to stand fast and use archers to weaken the Saracens as they approach and then launch a counter-charge at the right moment. Learning to judge the 'right moment' is part of matching King Richard's strategic skill!"}

["Acre_Description"]				{"Under the leadership of King Guy of Jerusalem the Crusaders besieged Acre, but were both discomforted by the arrival of a relief force under Saladin and encouraged by the arrival of their own reinforcements. King Guy and his advisors decided to launch an attack on the Muslim encampment, rather than simply concentrating on their siege works. Guy gave orders for his army to make ready for a pitched battle, and initially everything seemed to go well. He had chosen a reasonably strong position for his army, with one flank protected by the sea and the other by the River Belus, and his archers and crossbowmen in the front. But problems soon came about when his men - and especially the more mobile cavalry - realised there was the prospect of loot from the nearby Muslim encampment.

An appeal for help against the Saracens was sent to King Guy of Jerusalem. Count Raymond of Tripoli advised waiting where there was water and pasture for the cavalry, even though his own wife was under siege at Tiberias. King Guy, however, chose to listen to the Master of the Temple, the commander of the Knights Templar, whose plan involved an immediate attack. The Franks broke camp, left the road, and moved across the barren wasteland of the Plain of Toran. Whether through spies or traitors, Saladin was warned of the approaching Crusaders and moved his army to the hills at Hattin, ready to fall on the Crusaders as they came out of the waterless plain and before they had chance form a battle line.

On hearing that he had invaded towards Sidon, King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem ordered a counter-march to intercept the Saracen forces. Eventually, they reached a hilltop overlooking the Saracen encampment but, rather than waiting for their infantry to recover from the wearying march, the Frankish Crusaders advanced. Always impetuous - and in this case absolutely convinced that they were to have an easy victory by destroying the Saracens in camp - the nobles, knights and cavalry were soon disorganised and apart from the rest of the army. The supporting infantry was left straggling after, exhausted in the heat. Although there was a delay as Saracen skirmishers held off the Crusaders for a while, as the battle begins, the Crusader infantry forces are still not in proper positions to immediately affect the battle.

Concealing their own camp, the Mongols watched as the Hungarians pitched their tents on the opposite bank, unaware that only a thin stretch of water separated them from the Golden Horde! As Batu led an attack on the bridge and the Templars guarding it, Subadai forded the river upstream, outflanked and routed the Hungarians.
