// ii) If an untranslated string will have 
// (!ENG!) (!FRA!) (!DEU!) 
// (!ITA!) (!ESP!) (!JAP!) 
// (!SCH!) (!TCH!) (!KOR!)
// at the end of the string.
// This is so we can detect untranslated stings

// Once the translation has been done acceptably

@{"This leader glories in the swift and effective attack, ideally against the odds. He is a most dangerous foe, with a passionate interest in developing the attack potential of his forces, and a great willingness to test his troops in battle. His armies tend to be biased towards large numbers of assault troops, which can be a weakness."}
@{"This leader is patient, persistent and relentless. He is not fond of diplomacy, preferring to slowly and systematically crush all opposition. If you win against him, he will fall back, regroup, and attack again. He prefers to use heavily armoured and well trained troops, which may give highly mobile forces an advantage against him. A most dangerous foe."}
@{"Diplomacy and stealth backed up by unassailable fortifications are this leader's main strategies. He prefers to let a foe exhaust himself against his castle walls before taking the battle to him. It makes him more trustworthy than most, but still a difficult foe to defeat."}
@{"New methods, new technology, and new approaches to old problems are this leader's strengths. They are also possibly his weaknesses, as much effort tends to be put into development at the expense of troop numbers. A quick attack may catch him outnumbered, but eventually his troops will be so superior that numbers mean nothing."}
@{"This leader is a perfectionist. Everything he and his vassals do must be done well. He strives to make his troops well equipped and trained, his castles strong, and his land productive. His armies gain strength over time, and in a long campaign this leader could be very dangerous."}
@{"Stealth and secrecy delight this leader, and you can be assured that he will build up a spy network of unrivalled quality. That doesn't mean he neglects conventional forces - his armies are well balanced and strong. The quality of his spy and counterspy network makes it difficult to get detailed information on his forces, and very difficult to use spies and agents against him."}
@{"This leader prefers that an enemy should die at an assassin's hand rather than face him in battle. He is blamed for many untimely deaths, but often rightly so. His armies are also strong, and adept at exploiting the confusion that arises when an enemy general falls to an assassin's blade."}
@{"This leader prefers dialogue and diplomacy to all-out warfare. Many cynics believe this is not even a possibility, but he persists. It makes him a reliable ally, and someone you can ignore until greater threats are dealt with. However, do not leave yourself totally unguarded - his liking for consensus and agreement often allows his advisors to persuade him onto the battlefield."}
@{"This leader's main strategy is to hoard his troops. He is unlikely to attack until well prepared, which makes him predictable, but when the attack does come it is often with overwhelming force. The quality of his troops tends to be average, and his reluctance to commit them makes him one of the less dangerous opponents in a war."}
@{"This leader believes that investment in the present yields power in the future. That doesn't mean he is not an immediate danger - just that he will be more dangerous in times to come. Deal with him swiftly."}
@{"This leader is largely content with what he has, preferring to isolate himself from other warring factions and reap the prosperity of peace. This doesn't make him weak, but it does make him less likely to assault your borders than most. Once engaged in conflict he can be dangerous."}
@{"This leader believes in a careful balance between quality and quantity of forces, and aggressive campaigning against his enemies. He is untrustworthy as an ally, and his warlike nature makes him an unpopular neighbour."}
@{"The main strategy of this leader is to throw troops at his opponents in overwhelming numbers. The quality of his men is generally poor, but they are cheap and plentiful. He is unlikely to hold to an alliance for long, his expansionist urges making him a dangerous neighbour."}
@{"This leader specialises in the use of highly mobile and heavily armed forces to sweep foes from the battlefield. This strategy involves large cavalry formations, heavy armour, and high quality weaponry. It can lead to unbalanced armies, and this is an inherent weakness. He is expansionist and not particularly trustworthy. "}

@["Historical_event_text"]
@{"The Pope has convened a council at the town of Clermont and preached a mighty sermon calling upon all the faithful to come to the defence of Christianity, and to recapture the holy city of Jerusalem. Many listening gave vows on the spot to undertake these holy tasks."}
@{"The great project of Duke William the Bastard, now called the Conqueror, to know the worth of his new kingdom of England is finally complete. His assessors have not missed a single sheep, ox, horse, field, smithy, serf, or anything else in their work to value and tax the realm!"}
@{"Truly, this is a remarkable event, as a piece of the True Cross on which Our Lord redeemed the world, has come into the possession of the Paris Cathedral. It is now in a place of honour, and has made this a place of holy pilgrimage. Catholic Zeal has been increased across the whole of France."}
@{"Inspired by faith, given a taste of heaven on earth by their Master through the use of hashish, the Assassins are willing to slay their way into Paradise. Their murderous skills can be put to use by earthly potentates for their own less-than-heavenly purposes."}
@{"Peter the Hermit and his fellow zealot, the pauper knight Walter the Penniless, have roused the peasantry and simple folk. These two have convinced many to go on a Crusade secure in the fact that God will give them victory over infidels! All farm income in France is reduced by a tenth."}
@{"The code of knighthood binds men to behave in a brave and honourable manner, defend the weak, protect the virtuous, and give and receive every courtesy to friends and foes alike. Chivalry is an ideal that is not always achieved, but its emphasis on virtue helps to spread the Catholic faith more widely."}
@{"Abu Khamad al-Ghazali is one of Islam's greatest scholars: a jurist, philosopher, mystic and the father of Sufism. His work rejects both Aristotle and the rationalism of much Islamic thinking, focusing instead on the religion's mystical aspects. His philosophy of Islam is deeply appealing, bringing many into the faith in Turkish provinces."}
@{"Thanks to a failed plot against the Byzantine Emperor, Anna Comnena has had much time in a convent to pray, think, study and write. Her work - the Alexiad - is a glorious history of her father and the Byzantine Empire, and imparts +1 Influence to the Byzantine Emperor."}
@{"'Tis all a chequer-board of nights and days/where Destiny with Men for pieces plays:/Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,/and one by one back in the closet lays.' As well as a poet, Omar Kayyam is also a physicist, mathematician, astronomer and intellectual; his presence dampens Zeal in Turkish provinces, but grants governors +1 Acumen."}
@{"Geoffrey of Monmouth has completed his lively and sweeping epic "Historia Regum Britanniae". His accounts of the life of King Arthur and the deeds of the Knights of the Round Table are the most accurate and popular to date, and the English throne basks in reflected glory, gaining +1 Influence, while the people are diverted from matters of serious faith: -10% Zeal in English provinces."}
@{"Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been killed, slain by the King's men. Although a dreadful mistake, this murder has weakened the King's Influence and strengthened the position of the Catholic Church in all English provinces."}
@{"Bernard of Clairvaux, the Cistercian abbot, has called for a Crusade against the Saracens. His oratory and clear thought has also improved his ruler's Piety. His emphasis on the Virgin Mary also has appeal to many in Champagne."}
@{"A fanatical sect of heretics, the followers of the priest Bogomil, is on the rise. These "Bogomils" hold to the errant belief of dualism: that the material world is evil, and the spiritual world is good. They reject the truth that God created the world, the sanctity of marriage, and the Church's authority. The foul heretics are currently gaining support in Bulgaria and Wallachia."}
@{"The brain of St Eustace, as uncorrupted by the passage of years as the rest of his mortal remains, will surely become a notable relic, once it has been properly sealed in a jewelled reliquary so that its holy perfection will be preserved. Pilgrims from all across northern Italy will surely flock to see this wonder, raising the Zeal of the entire region!"}
@{"The Lords of Champagne have encouraged trade in their lands for many years, showing much wisdom in knowing that trade, as well as land, brings wealth to a people. Champagne has easy-flowing rivers to bring merchants and their goods from far away, all to trade at the Great Fair. This wise policy gives the governor of Champagne +3 Acumen."}
@{"Averroes is among the foremost thinkers of this age. Few others match the quality of his study of Aristotle, or his belief in rationalism. His commentaries on Aristotle's works are prized by both Islamic and Christian scholars. Added to this are his outstanding skills as a physician. This model of wisdom reduces Zeal in both Christian and Islamic Spain."}
@{"In his many verses, Chretien de Troyes retells the stories of Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the Knights of the Round Table in great and glorious detail. His words speak of the joys and pleasures of romance and love, distracting many from more religious thoughts. -10% Zeal in all of France."}
@{"Hildegard, the Prioress of Bingen, has achieved acclaim for her worthy powers of healing and her scholarship in the medical field. She has also published two books and is known as a visionary, who has been encouraged and praised by archbishops and even the Pope, after she wrote of her visions. Her presence bolsters the Catholic Church in Germany and grants +1 Health in Germany."}
@{"Although the North is Christian, at times it seems like the old religions are still lurking in the darker forests. Eric's efforts on behalf of the Church have been prodigious, and the Catholic Church is bolstered throughout Scandinavia by his achievements."}
@{"The King of England has issued 16 articles, defining all the legal dealings between the Church and his servants. These articles limit the powers and rights of the clergy and the Pope when dealing with English matters. The English King gains +1 Influence and -1 Piety as a result."}
@{"A composer of elegant poetry for the Byzantine court, Theodore Prodromus also composes romantic verse novels and even - so it is rumoured - satirical ditties in Greek for everyone to enjoy! That such a talented man is in the Imperial Court adds lustre to the throne, and grants +1 Influence and -10% Zeal."}
@{"A reliable guide that can point the way to the north in all weathers and at night is a blessing to sailors. They need not hug the coast, praying that the weather will be kind to them. Now, in larger ships, they can sail with confidence across the ocean!"}
@{"The heretical beliefs and perverted sexual practices of the Cathars can be ignored no longer! The simple are being swayed by their lies! Their teachings deny holy authority, doctrines of the Sacrament, the Cross, and even the Creation of the world by God! Their supporters grow in strength in Toulouse, Provence, Genoa, Milan, Franconia and Bavaria!"}
@{"A new version of the popular Arthurian tale of Tristan and Isolde is currently proving very popular. Written by Gottried von Strassburg, this version of the story of the doomed lovers is superb and draws in all who hear it, distracting them from worthier pastimes, such as their religious devotions! -10% Zeal in Franconia and surrounding provinces."}
@{"Preaching out against heresy, Dominic and his Order have made a great name for themselves: the "Domine Canes" or The Hounds of the Lord, a pun on their name Dominicans. Dominic is an implacable opponent of heresy, and whips up support for the True Church. All Spanish provinces gain a minimum of +10% Zeal and many converts for the Catholic Church."}
@{"The Albigensian heretics are an offshoot of the Cathars, and follow many of their erroneous teachings, but go further in their rejection of the Church, its priests and all that is sacred! These Cathars may hide behind a new name, but heresy must always be extirpated! Their strength grows in Toulose, Provence, Aquitaine and Genoa."}
@{"A miracle has occurred! The True Cross, on which Jesus suffered and died for our sins, has been found and is now in the possession of Mother Church in Castile! This will surely draw virtuous pilgrims from across Spain to see it and the Cathedral where it is housed. Catholic zeal increased throughout Spain."}
@{"The teachings of Francis of Assisi on poverty and a simple lifestyle devoted to God are attracting followers and have won Papal approval. His words have brought many to the Church and his new Order of Monks, the Franciscans, impress with their devotion to God and renunciation of wealth. Conversion to Catholicism and Zeal bonuses are increased in the Papal States, Tuscany, Rome, Naples and Genoa."}
@{"One of the great epic stories of German legend, the Niebelungenlied has become more than just a heroic poem in Germany. It is a part of what makes German culture recognisably 'German'. This is helping to unite the nation of the Germans as a single entity, and inspires all Holy Roman Empire generals, granting them +1 Loyalty."}
@{"Nicetas Choniates is one of the greatest living scholars of his age, a worthy successor to the noble Anna Commena. His works, although not always charting the unfading glory of Byzantium or the Orthodox Church, do reflect well upon the current occupant of the throne. +1 Influence to the Byzantine Emperor and -10% Zeal in all Orthodox provinces."}
@{"A Crusade of innocent children to retake the Holy Land through the power of their virtue is a noble idea. The practicalities and venal cruelty of many make it a doomed expedition, for the children have vanished, possibly sold into slavery from the port of Venice. Farm income in France and the Holy Roman Empire is reduced, and the bereft parents are turning away from the Church to heretical beliefs."}
@{"The lords and barons of England have succeeded in limiting the King's powers over them and lesser men in the land. While the King's standing suffers a little (-1 Influence), this act binds the nobility closely to their monarch. +3 Loyalty to all English Generals."}
@{"The learning of Albertus Magnus, in particular his understanding of the ancient philosopher Aristotle and of Arabic thinkers, is truly a wonder of any age. His reasoning and books on Aristotle make him an ornament to the Church and a force for rationality. -10% Zeal in Germany, but the Catholic Church gains converts."}
@{"Roger Bacon is a teacher of the works of Aristotle, and deeply interested in Arabic science, even writing a vast encyclopaedia, the Opus Maius. His interests are passed to his students, even though Bacon's thoughts and writings occasionally smack of wizardry. +1 Influence to the English King, but -10% Zeal in English provinces."}
@{"Bonaventure - from Francis of Assisi exclaiming "O, Good Fortune!" over him when a sick child - is Master of the Franciscans, a scholar equal to Thomas Aquinas, a friend of kings and popes and a holy man indeed. By word and deed he inspires great zeal in the Church's flock in northern Italy."}
@{"Ibn Rushd is among the foremost thinkers of this age. Few others match the quality of his study of Aristotle, or his belief in radical rationalism. His commentaries are prized by both Islamic and Christian scholars, as are his outstanding skills as a physician. -10% Zeal in all of Almohad Spain."}
@{"A marvellous relic has been discovered and now it adds the blessing of sanctity to the magnificence of the Cathedral in Milan. It is a miracle that the Baptist's holy skull - and his skull at the age of twelve no less! - is now in the possession of the True Church! Catholic Zeal is increased throughout northern Italy."}
@{"Thanks to the arcane skills of the alchemists a new substance, gunpowder, is now available. While it may have the sulphurous reek of Satan when used, be fit only for peasants and make a horrendous racket, it can only be a matter of time before gunpowder appears on the battlefield."}
@{"Thomas Aquinas is one of the most learned men of his age, and a true son of the Church. Not even an impure woman sent by his own family could make him renounce the Dominican vows of chastity he has taken. His teachings and adherence to doctrine inspire Zeal and increase the Church's flock in Italy."}
@{"Usury or lending money for profit is often considered a sin. But the rise of moneyed families - who are prepared to lend to merchants, look after those same merchants' surplus cash, and even transfer money between branches of the family in different provinces - is a vital advance for trade."}
@{"There were 12 hours in a day from dawn to dusk. In summer, the hours were long, in winter, short. Time was measured in tomorrows, todays and yesterdays, but no longer. The clock now strikes out the hours with heavenly regularity, making men work and trade to its fast beat, and work harder as a result."}
@{"The barons of Spain have succeeded in their struggle to limit the King's powers. The King has been forced to hand over hard-won royal privileges and rights, reducing his Influence. The nobility, however, see the advantages of supporting the new arrangements. +2 Loyalty to all Spanish Generals."}
@{"One of the "Schoolmen", John Duns Scotus, has worked hard to reconcile the philosophy of Aristotle with the teachings of the Church. He has often had a great rationalizing effect, although many of his arguments are too subtle for the great mass of the Faithful. Zeal is reduced in Scotland, Northumbria, Mercia and Wales."}
@{"Surrounded by greedy enemies and vulnerable in the Empire's constant struggles, the Swiss cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden have signed a compact pledging mutual aid against all enemies. Although a small start, this Swiss Confederation can have sharp teeth: the pikes in the hands of its many soldiers!"}
@{"Dante's powerful work, the Divine Comedy, takes its reader on a journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. Dante also makes powerful allegorical and political arguments against his enemies. One of the greatest stories ever written, it nevertheless has religious and political points to score. Zeal is reduced in Venice and the Doge's Influence also suffers slightly."}
@{"Marco Polo's tales of his travels across the world, to the court of the Great Mongol Khan and far Cathay would amaze any who heard them. The wealth and power of his imagination confounds belief, but the spices and silks he brings are more than welcome as trade goods. There are new goods for trade in Tripoli and Syria."}
@{"A great assembly, from the noblest lord to the humblest landowner, each gathered into their own 'estate' or class of person, has been brought together to give their consent to the King's laws. His powers to raise taxes and use the money as he pleases are marks of his power. +1 to the French King's influence."}
@{"The weather has been most unnatural, uncanny and unkind. The winter snows were very late in thawing, the spring rains were heavy and prolonged and the summer sun never came at all. As the year turns, the snows have come early, the crops are poor, and the rivers freeze. Across northern Europe income will suffer this year."}
@{"A most remarkable relic of Our Lord has been discovered, a wondrous survival and proof of his presence on earth - a piece of bread that he once dined upon! Surely such a relic will be a holy adornment to the Cathedral in Paris, bringing benefits of healing and sanctity to the faithful of France who make pilgrimage! +10% Zeal in all of Catholic France."}
@{"Meister Johannes Eckhart, the Dominican scholar and leader, and the vicar of Bohemia, has been accused of questionable and heretical thought. His discussions of the soul and God, show the influence of Greek and even Arabic scholarship and are not in accordance with Church doctrine. His pernicious influence has caused many to think heretical thoughts in Franconia, Bohemia, Freisland and Flanders."}
@{"William of Ockham has aided scholarship in the most simple and profound way. His proposal is that the simplest explanation of a problem is always the best explanation. With this one idea - "Ockham's Razor" - he has given scholars a rule for dealing with questions of nature, faith and life. -10% Zeal in all English Provinces."}
@{"The concept of Buridan's Ass - a stubborn creature that, unable to make a choice, starves to death - is a comedic illustration of free will requiring judgement. But Jean Buridan's works of philosophy go far beyond free will, donkeys and determinism taking in optics, mechanics and logic. -10% Zeal in all French Provinces."}
@{"Francesco Petrarca was born in Arezzo, Italy. Since that time, he has travelled widely, been well educated and enjoyed the good life. This has not stopped him from becoming a poet of distinction, all inspired by the beauty of one woman, whom he calls Laura in his works. These distracting poems cause at least -10% Zeal in much of northern Italy."}
@{"Boccaccio's great work, the ten tales of the Decameron, stand out from the work of other poets of the age. It is fortunate that he is so good as, having been born into a merchant family and been apprenticed in one of the new banks, he showed little talent for business! His works cause at least -10% Zeal throughout northern Italy."}
@{"Plague and Death now hold dominion, and the dead are almost numberless. No town, no village, no household has been spared. The living suffer the torments of the damned, the stench from the plague pits carries the Black Death to all corners of the world and prayer is the only salvation."}
@{"In Spain the local people have turned on the Jews and, aided by their lords and officials, have driven them from many provinces. There has been much bloodshed and looting of Jewish property, under the guise of religiously inspired outrage and hatred. Sensibly, the Jews who weren't killed have fled."}
@{"John Wycliffe, a passionate reformer of the Church's practices, has embraced heretical thought with his attacks on the Church's hierarchy. His attacks on Church leaders, their wealth and privileges are particularly unwelcome, unnecessary and unwise, as is his interpretation of Biblical authority. His words are tempting many to heresy in Wessex, Mercia and Northumbria."}
@{"The Golden Bull codifies much Imperial power, in particular the method of electing a new Emperor. By this edict, interference from the Church is minimised, and the power of the Emperor and his seven Electors is enhanced. It is a triumph of legality and internal diplomacy within the Empire, increasing the Influence of the Emperor."}
@{"The Church has made a miraculous acquisition: the loincloth worn by Our Lord on the Cross. This sacred garment will surely bring great honour to the Cathedral at Bamberg, and inspire great Zeal in the faithful in Franconia and surrounding provinces."}
@{"The renowned judge, Ibn Battutah, has returned from another of his journeys to the Indies and Cathay. The tales he writes of his voyages to these far countries are remarkable, but even more remarkable are the beautiful trade goods that he brings also. Truly travel broadens more than the mind, and now there are new goods for trade in Khazar and the Crimea."}
@{"The Diwan of Shams al-Din Mohammed, also called Hafiz Shirazi, is one of the greatest poetry works of the age, a collection of ghazal, or poems in a lyrical style. Hafiz is a title given to a Muslim who has memorized the Koran, and his education clearly shines through his work. Many who have not already done so convert to Islam in Islamic provinces, while Islamic Zeal is reduced."}
@{"From the age of six, Catherine of Siena saw guardian angels protecting people. She has continued to have visions of Our Lord, Mary and the Saints ever since. Few match her piety, self-instructed theology and support for the Pope and she is an inspiration to many in the True Church, her support granting Influence to the Pope."}
@{"John Ball is a foul heretic, given to preaching many errors and scandals against King and Church and no good will come to his immortal soul. His attacks on the privileged, wealthy and positioned are not to be tolerated. They stir up the simple and lowly to foolish rebellion! Wessex is now a hotbed of heresy and disloyalty!"}
@{"By turns witty, bawdy, sad, funny, and always worldly-wise, the Canterbury Tales are proving popular with all those who read them, perhaps too popular in that they are slightly disrespectful of the pillars of authority in the world: the True Church, and the King! However, there is -20% Zeal in English provinces, while the King's Influence is increased."}
@{"The followers of John Wycliffe, the Lollards, can only be considered as revolting heretics of the worst kind. They not only read the Bible for themselves and reject the Church's hierarchy, but also question doctrine on transubstantiation, clerical celibacy and even propound their own ideas of free love and pacifism! Mercia is now a hotbed of heresy and disloyalty!"}
@{"John Froissart continues to work on his great histories, much to the glory of France and the royal family! This priest, poet and courtier is one of the foremost historians in Europe, and any work by him is sure to be influential among scholars, positively colouring their view of France! The French King's Influence is increased."}
@{"The work of the diplomat Manuel Chrysolaras in translating the works of Homer and Plato brings glory to the Byzantine Empire! These classics of rationality will surely have an effect in bringing classical philosophy to a wider audience of scholars, therefore countering the terrible effects of ignorance! The Emperor's Influence is increased."}
@{"John Wycliffe's heretical teachings have influenced another to turn from the Church and have erroneous thoughts. Jan Hus, a fiery and influential speaker, has been criticising the Church and stirring up trouble against the Germans too. Not only has he criticised the Emperor, he has challenged the Pope's authority too! Bohemia is now a hotbed of heresy and disloyalty!"}
@{"A wonder of this and all ages to come! A most precious holy relic from Our Lord has come into the possession of Mother Church: wood from the True Cross! Surely its survival to this very day is proof enough of its authenticity? Catholic Zeal is increased throughout Italy."}
@{"Thanks to royal patronage and encouragement, the Portuguese Gil Eanes has voyaged far south across the Atlantic Ocean and along the coast of Africa. His success in travelling so far brings glory to the royal house, and opens up new opportunities for welcome trade. There are new trading goods available in Portugal."}
@{"Jacques Coeur, the merchant, banker to many in royal circles, a master of the mint, and advisor to Kings, has done much to improve trade in France. His wise counsel and clever schemes have increased the general wealth to the benefit of many, and the King of France's Acumen is also increased."}
