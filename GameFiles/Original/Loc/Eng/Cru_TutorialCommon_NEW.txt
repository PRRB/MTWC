 The next tutorial and practice battle will help you learn more tactics to defeat your enemies."}

["Bulgaria1_Practice_Lost"]

 to defeat the enemy. Use your spearmen to protect your archers while they destroy the enemy."}

{"Spearmen are effective against mounted units."}

["PM_HEIGHT_ADVANTAGE_ARROW"]
{"From an elevated position your archers can fire further."}

 may stretch the enemy, then lead the attack with your heavily armoured foot knights. Also remember your war engines may
 also target troops."}
